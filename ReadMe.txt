IF THE GRADER IS UNABLE TO RUN THE CODE:

We have included PNGs of the outputs of each of our models 
and the metrics associated with them. They are stored in the
graphs folder, and organized by subreddit. The name of each inidividual
model and metric is attached to each graph, and will provide the statistics 
on our sentiment analysis.

SIDE NOTE:

In order to use the venv you may have to run a specific command
if your IDE does not automatically use it.

For windows:
C:\> env\Scripts\activate.bat

For mac:
$ source venv/Scripts/activate

~~~~ It is important to use the venv since the libraries will be the 
ones that are compatible with the code, as well as the ones that will
make it work bug-free!!!~~~~
