----------------------------

Sidenote:

In order to use the venv you may have to run a specific command
if your IDE does not automatically use it.

For windows:
C:\> env\Scripts\activate.bat

For mac:
$ source myvenv/bin/activate

~~~~ It is important to use the venv since the libraries will be the 
ones that are compatible with the code, as well as the ones that will
make it work bug-free!!!~~~~
