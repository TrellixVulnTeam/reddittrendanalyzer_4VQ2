I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... 
Dogs are so dumb sometimes but always so good :) I love dem dumb ones
The smile on these guys face, the will and passion to explore all gone in a second. Rest in peace explorers!
Well, [NAME] definitely a better actor but [NAME] seems like a better match for [NAME]
Same! Protect yourself as much as you can. I also clean the phone and the case :D
Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.
[NAME] is my 2nd favorite QB after [NAME]. Very high ceiling and [NAME] always seems to get the best out of his QBs
Same. Glad it's not just out store.
Easy money, thank you [NAME]
Always. And on a shallower note, he is aging so well, the handsome devil. 
Congratulations! I know it‚Äôs a hard thing to quit, I‚Äôm proud of you. 
That's totally my focus for today, just enjoy the day and being there for myself :) it's so liberating.
Haha Thank you. It got hard to choose who is with what after OSU, PSU, Michigan and Rutgers
That should be fun. I may have call in sick tomorrow. Lots of Bournemouth fans including my boss.
"she said (i swear to [NAME]) her doctors told her she wasnt bipolar and has ""anxiety caused by other people"" "
I missed you [NAME] you're pretty cool
Nobody has the money to. What a joke
She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As a wise man once said: he was a bastard in life thus a bastard in death 
Or, or.....hear me out on this....have a cup of tea (UK) and then just move the problem to a different location.
[NAME] it‚Äôs ok the trumpet player can‚Äôt hurt you anymore
There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
I wish they didn‚Äôt hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
I remember 2008-2010. Phones couldn't do that yet. Phones had 640x480 screens back then, and believe me, we were amazed by that.
I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).
I will third Blues City Deli...the Prez [NAME] is ridiculous!
Stop doing weird things
People are legitimately monsters.
Not anymore it seems.
Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.
If I have to watch Canada lose in a shootout I'm gonna lose it
you da real mvp!
As well as this, tell others about your classes AND schedule. Your Fe might be weak but it still makes you do stuff.
Games like this are just demoralizing for our players.
Because deep down you know that you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Be grateful someone told you.
It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
Don't read, it just gets worse! 
Hi Tired, I'm Dad. And I'm very disappointed in you for following your older brother's example and becoming a trap that poses for /b/
It's good, good, good, good - good good good!
Lol I know, right? It's unsettling how bloodthirsty some people are. 
He does look much better
No, just a bastard pastry
Love the laugh at the end
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
Thank you. It's great that I can come here and have lovely people like you help me to not feel so alone.
He‚Äôs a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.
kid still sad after eating food, because it WASN'T A HAPPY MEAL.
Yep exactly, and he never demands the ball as well. He's afraid of it.
Ah well hopefully they learn from this. You can never be overprepared for a live show.
Such a *great* feeling
the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy
These subtitles are stupid & unnecessary.
That's an unusual idea, I must try it out! Thank you!
Having that thought kind of makes you an asshole
Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that.
Happy Cake Day! I, too, have been a victim of cake.
I wish. Chalk it up to a brain fart
"He looks great in ""Ideal Home""."
I‚Äôm gay, so let‚Äôs hope this works! I look better clean shaven lmao. Thanks! 
I TOOK TOO MUCH OF A RISK IM SORRY
Shes stunning haha
Sorry. This thing knows whats up!
Maybe 10-12 years ago lol
I'm not counting on them getting elected. I'm counting on them putting enough pressure on the Conservatives to actually become at least a little conservative.
I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying
That‚Äôs what I meant, sorry bout that. Never fold AKs pre 
I could not agree more. Actually, last week I played in my first smash bros tournament! (I lost, obviously) 
This is pretty worrying and makes me wonder why she can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not normal.
THANK YOU!!
‚ÄúLove‚Äù under threat of execution. Wow.
How can you look at that. it hurts.
I‚ÄôM HOT ALL THE TIME :( pre-pregnancy I was cold a lot. This is worse.
That comment reads like something out of a circlejerk sub. I can't believe it was said unironically
It‚Äôs tough to adjust when counter-battery is incoming. They‚Äôre just hoping for that one-round FFE.
Thanks my boet
It is the truth lol
Love situations like this...excited to see if he'll make it by tomorrow
You seem slightly sensitive... I was actually thinking we had been infiltrated by the normies
Right, I never said it wasn't. There's been a lot of unjust laws. I was just curious if you actually agreed with that.
so obnoxious.
Lol nicely done
I‚Äôm sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. 
You don't suck, jazz is amazing man. Thanks for a album to listen.
No she does not, not alone and not during sex(sadly) 
i'm so poor i don't even know any horse girls
Now I remember, you're an OC student. This sub tells me you're brilliant...
Well good...opera is often beautiful..though it retains the stink of the upper classes.. I cant help but deride art that caters to high society to stay alive.
Does nobody notice that this is a doctored photo..?? Like really bad clone stamp.. I mean it could be beautiful but this is not a real photo.
This idiot can't be bothered to comprehend anything that reads longer than a bumper sticker.
How‚Äôd you get out there? I miss the west. Love NYC tho
fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all
Alright, thanks for that tip! <3
Haven‚Äôt watched much of his other stuff but I loved his debunking of [NAME].
Well I was balding at 22 so I didn't have choice lol
It's a prime-time soap. I feel so guilty.
Been their. We got into a huge argument and that caused our first break up. Video games...
Dragopolis was a less fun version of the free dinosaur game on Chrome when your internet goes out
Yes, you just push. I've been having periods for 29 years (bloody hell) and I've never managed to get to grips with applicators.
"""Highline poles""; I'll keep those in mind. Thanks. "
All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
I worry that as soon as VR and AR take off, it'll be the nail in the coffin and we will be trapped.
It‚Äôs a pretty good guess for most college students in the south in my experience.
I feel so sorry for [NAME]..
Yea I saw that...had me worried for a sec but I had no trouble at Delta
*right, [NAME]. thank you for clarifying.
Very excited for what could come from his presidency, very much not excited for the primaries.
Oh, doi. Makes total sense now. Boy I really hope I get fired for this blunder.
Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don‚Äôt seem to be enough sometimes
I literally do not like this
Intresting. Well I sure did learn something today! Cheers!
I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
BURN IT DOWN
Grandma is bad at math
Well shit, then it's just like [NAME] wouldn't let me complete a maths degree just because I'm ideologically opposed to this 'algebra' thing!
Folks, the Baconator is great! Ask anyone, it's the best sandwich. The bacon is amazing. Great sandwich.
Too busy being on that stupid ass mystery singer show
He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
Nice watches, Id love to get one if they were a bit closer to my price range
:( bastards
Be honest with her... or put her on a pedestal just high enough to see up her dress... ;)
Breaking bad all over again
I'm sorry. Now my entire bad pun looks even worse than it did when I started.
Get off my property
Acne scars unfortunately and also out of anxiety I tend to pick at my skin.
This guy is a hack lmao
That's beyond fucking creepy!
Same, also no parking so they need to pull in the busy road outside my house. They must hate me.
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.
Despite what you may feel about me, I‚Äôm happy you got that off your chest, I hope you feel better!
You‚Äôre a vile vile person and a rapist. I hope the police are onto you.
I meant mainsource [NAME]. the one that assists you on your journey. >! not the one that is evil as fuck!<
Had me worried for a bit. As a [NAME], I‚Äôve always been impressed with [NAME] love of their country ( great anthem too).
Bless his heart
Off the top of my head I don't think he lost a game for Queensland in that time either.
i agree that far right are not our friends bur this seems fake af
>ultra-conservatives Um excuse me, I'm actually a Plus Ultra Conservative, thanks!
How scary! She loves you! I hope you are ok.
Sorry, I mean that closing the carried interest loophole would raise $18 billion over ten years according to the NY Times. I mistyped.
I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
No, [NAME] has said more than once it was not. 
We don't lmao. Anything with humans will have the same problems.
My dad had the same problem in the same fingers thanks Op .I'll share this with my dad.
Have a wonderful day.
This is why I have no sympathy for parents who can't make time for their kids because of their jobs.
Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit
lol not bullying. Just a socially aware nerd complaining about how annoying most of my people are. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[NAME], give us the opera album we deserve
It was fucking in!!
I see. Thanks again.
muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
Who the fuck leaves a hot iron on the couch
Absolutely true. Sit down to pee at home, the splashback is real. Especially if you're tall. 
And I dub thee [NAME]. An uninteresting name for an uninteresting person who has done absolutely nothing with their life.
Oh [NAME] I needed that laugh
That was the best time to be Black in LA
Fuck ya boys let‚Äôs go
[NAME] is such a wholesome woman. The world needs more people like her.
Lol what do you mean ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
I don't know about you but parroting racist lies created specifically to devalue AM sexuality is a pretty serious indicator of racism to me.
Wow! That takes guts! I‚Äôm so squeamish that I can hardly stand getting a shot üòÇ
nearly choked on my chicken breast
Truly incredible work ;)
I don't, I think this is great. The more they disbelieve media, the more it hurts them.
That would be fantastic!!
[NAME] office just denied it
Damn that sucks dude! Personally I‚Äôd fill the soil with barbed wire so when they stick their hands in they‚Äôd get nice and cut up
"Ok maybe I misunderstood your argument, so your just sayin that state's still have significant ""autonomous"" power? Because I agree with that."
You're in the best place in Canada for outdoor activities.
Good luck my dude, took me three OD's before I realized I should probably stop.
> Is it weird to have more sympathy for animals than humans? It's frighteningly common, so not *weird*, but it's definitely sad
It may get you pregnant so just make sure you eat all her birth control before hand.
She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place.
Who will rid me of these meddlesome Golden Knights?
It's fucking incredible how many people would like you if you would just make eye contact and smile at them. Fucking incredible
Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
Yeah but they actully had/have shit to be mad about. Their board is incapable.
I don't know about the rain but my friend suggested that it could look a tiny bit like Malachor.
No mate. Don't keep in touch with any of them anymore.
Yeah no haha. Out of my price range tbh
"[NAME] hears bible verses and is like ""fuck this shit"""
Same thing happened to me last year ended horribly
That's great, keep fighting the good fight!
Probably clipped wings too, judging by the way it went down. Idiots.
The first article on their is talking about the [NAME] documentary...? E - there*. What the hell is my phone doing
"""Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of them are stupider than that."" - [NAME]"
Some fragile egos seem very upset at the ad. womp, womp.
And I'm sure grandmas in SC love the stereotype of the violent black man.
Appreciate the love! Maybe during the offseason, for sure! I'll pass it along
In my mind. I forgot everything :(
Hahaha I KNEW y'all were gonna post this
Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT MAMA
Of course not. Why admit their circle jerk was wrong? They'll only learn the lesson after the lawsuit ends.
And any form of bottom up government is also extremely susceptible to corruption. Basically, humans suck. 
Fuck shit bitch
Or at the very least, why can't healers have HAMMERS!? (... I miss Legion :(]
Dressing room back bone is not somebody who always blames others for his mistakes on the pitch.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
I wanted to see him show out over Kemba.
If [NAME] loses I‚Äôll break my phone, [NAME] is fighting like wilder what the fuck is this comeback
That‚Äôs an interesting point, thank you.
Thanks love <3
Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.
[NAME] is having a great start to the game. Very gritty and I love it. Plz keep him.
we will see I hope your right. all we can do is play our best.
It also would have to take less than like 2 hours for me to get to my destination, time is worth more to me than real money ya know
Not even polite if they're driving. The road rage here is terrifying.
> It‚Äôd make porn ~~awkward~~ awesome FTFY
I like it
I would think that would be pretty awkward having phone sex with a stranger
Thats weak as fuck.
Now it makes sense.
I think that‚Äôs accurate. The probably I think means maybe will get a set
This made me chuckle. I hope it is raptors v warriors in the finals. That‚Äôs gonna be a fun series to watch.
Come on, this would be funny with a better caption.
Osaka making me nervous
That sounds like an amazing trick.
[NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
lol that‚Äôs what I was gonna say.
I hate losing to the Blackhawks like I love my wife: Intensely.
Hahahahaha. That's hilarious. Oops! Thanks for pointing out my typo. I think I'll leave it.
Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is.
Ok, I will take this with a pinch of salt, but take it into consideration nonetheless. Thanks.
Same here, she left the house we bought and is giving me till the end of the month. Woooo
In case anyone is wondering.. the money was a 20$ tip. Edit: 200$. I‚Äôve been corrected.
Why can't I get Hulu in Canada yet!! So annoying
Damn that‚Äôs a big F from me :(
I disagree. Every starting receiver [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] will have over 1k yards on the season while [NAME] cracks 2k. 
Oh damn I'm a clemson student I swore I had a flair on here
Plot twist, she's accepted [NAME] as her Lord and Savior.
It‚Äôs simpler to prove that something exists than to prove that something has always existed, Occam is on my side lol
Ehh, still pretty ambitious lobs for [NAME] though. I'd get it if it was [NAME]. 
I‚Äôm pregnant and my dog is with my parents across the country while we renovate. The feels were too much üò≠
This is perfect
The foul, smelly dump I just took > fallout 76
Man, fuck that shit. He lost us the Sonics, he has no business running for public office.
When the gov shut down under [NAME] many were calling for his resignation. This is similar, but people already hate [NAME] so obviously people are more angry.
I think: Congrats! That baby will now have loving parents
I saw it on the internet, so it must be true!
I‚Äôm sorry. If it was me- go straight to divorce and file. Why prolong the pain and abuse.
nsfw pls, thanks nice work doe
as a woman, I can tell ya it‚Äôs not uncommon for that to happen, haha. [NAME] make it extra sad though.
Welcome to the new normal.
Oh my gosh üòÇ. I do believe it!!
I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate it. <3 Thank you.
Victimless crime? Fuck you! Sounds like your unrepentant for being a crippling alchoholic.
Damn.. fell for that one
I picked up some sea pods the other day for like $8 us online and I love them, zero leaks and great flavour!
Love it.
I'm sorry, there is no way this guy is Canadian.
Thank you for sharing this. May your friend rest easy and you find peace.
"I live in australia and even aussies say ""cook the man some eggs"" as a joke to kiwis"
Lighten up buddy.
I really appreciate you saying that And yes he is the cutest
This is actually funny
Are you really that brain dead.....idiot!!!
Great idea to brag about workplace violation on Facebook!
Can we get a guard too? This is my dream.
No. Can‚Äôt get off to my own sex.
> This isn't where I parked my car Seriously I can't find my car.
Oh great so now i need a tv license or to watch in potato. This is piss poor.
as long as the tracking shows delivered, it's not your responsibility what happens to it after that
Sounds awesome, but I am so out of practice I'd be embarrassed to show up lol.
Damn... That means a lot. Thank you!
Thanks friend, you have a good day! ([NAME] is fab btw just not quite [NAME] or [NAME] for me!)
I always get concerned when I see Nono standing at the stove or being instructed to pick Milania up from demon spawn practice.
Currently [NAME], I just finished watching season 1 and I really like her. Bendelacreme is my all time favorite tho
I keep getting my posts removed and banned from that sub. üòí
Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. 
The irony of you guys using an American website created because of capitalism is funny
And NO DOGS sign. This is perfect.
Sad and very true though. Case in point.
"They could have checkmated the ""journalists"" and avoided this situation by saying they decided to switch to only pay for quality journalistic work."
The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo.
Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.
>both parties are dumb >stupid tribalism ü§îü§îü§î
I earned the money, I bought the food and I cooked the food so don't go thanking your phoney baloney god for it in my home.
Unfortunately on my end, it‚Äôs only pecks during sex. Pretty boring. Never open mouthed or anything like that. 
Ha! Had to go back and look. Pens.... I was seriously wondering wtf this was, a giant penis-shaped gummy bear?!
radical would be good. Poverty has to be erased before society is allowed to maximize individual wealth as it is doing now.
I died a little inside watching all of that champagne go to waste.
‚ÄúYour‚Äù people are mentally ill and need help. Go get it ASAP!
[NAME] damn you're toxic asf
Oh yeah, those are both totally valid criticisms. It's just that they lose me when they call him a serial predator
I was always in awe of just how stunning she was. She doesn't photograph well though, it's a shame. 
thats cool to hear ... [NAME] really is laughable in this regard
Thanks for calling me an idiot... was definitely necessary.
Too ugly for love/romance/sex/dating
What an abusive piece of crap. Those poor boys won‚Äôt know how to be adults. I hope their father is in their lives.
oh, that's cool! Well, i'll say that the budget for this one definitely shows!
Franz Ferdinand are awful too
Every instagram page posts this lol
That‚Äôs awesome, wonder if it‚Äôs available to buy on eBay. 
Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
No... There are many ways to prove you are [NAME]. I've heard of people that proved they are [NAME] by showing that their mother speaks Yidish.
thank you so much <3
Thank you for that link, ended up finally having a nice quote to make as a flair
Sure, rape isn't caused by poverty. You can compare poor whites vs poor hispanics too. 
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.
Just shut up dude
> appreciation and celebrations From the sidebar: > For **anything** about the YouTube gaming channel Game Grumps
That's awesome!! Look forward to watching this kids progress in year 2
no do not destroy [NAME] pope and glorius god emperor will cry :((((
One day I just want to show up to my parents‚Äô with a Starbucks cup or maybe some Taco Bell on a Sunday.
Yep! It's still busy. Slightly less crowded but still fun!
Yay I feel so uplifted!!!
That is a valid question, I hope it can change, but admittedly that hope is pretty small.
I wish I was there lol
"*""Wow""*"
The real problem is the malicious prosecution engaged in by Monsanto against small farmers.
[NAME] combat is terrible and the only reason I don‚Äôt play it anymore
This is just a terrible joke
This is the game that finally lost my faith.
That's a very smart move. Anyway, congrats gamer girl, this is epic!
>You can't purge dissenting opinions over there like you do here. Yes, because top minds definitely doesn't purge dissenting opinions. 
Haha so give it a try is what you are saying üòÇüòÇ
i love this video
[NAME] üë©üë©üë© this Is for real, this makeup üíÑ üíÑüíã makes you glow üåü‚ú® no üö´üö´üö´üö´ filters needed üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ
Some of us can't do syrup any more. :(
this team is hard to watch, things that can so easily be fixed to make us great that are just persistent fuck ups and we refuse to fix them
Is that supposed to be outrageous? Assuming he met the requirements and earned them all, good on the guy for planning for his future.
that day humanity received a grim reminder
Excited for you guys to be there see you there [NAME]!
Of course that's possible but you need to provide some proof.
You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break.
Well you came to the right place
You sound jealous as fuck. Work hard and you too can drive a nice car.
Yup, he's still one of the strongest turtles in the game though. Eventually you're gonna have to attack.
Yup! Lol
Reminds me of my favorite [NAME] post
I‚Äôm embarrassed how long it took for me to figure this out. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The joke doesn't even have anything to do with the song.
This is perfect!
Where are my testicles, [NAME]? Edit: thanks for the silver!
Is it cruel to give your kids medicine when they don‚Äôt know what it is and why, if they need it?
Its not exactly what I thought it was gonna be either, but its okay, there's a lot of food.
Just like how one day a magic unicorn might appear and prove us all wrong about them not existing.
 I'm scared to even ask my mom ,I might get yelled at üòü
Ah damn it.
You are forgetting driving. Somehow the law is full of examples of this double standard.
Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
I never had a problem with the old parachuting mechanic, but I like the new one and I think it might actually be better.
I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
It's a shame that so many experimental psychology studies are still using such dubious statistical practices.
I apologised an very long time ago as I was wrong at this point you are beating a dead horse
He's an altogether better grappler IMO, and so much fun.
I love you and your love for your dogs. You matter, and I hope that you're able to access and find treatment to improve your life.
I am just afraid the Pistons front office, specifically [NAME] overvalues [NAME] and says no to this.
Have to agree. The government welfare and biased divorce courts which are enforced by the state are to blame.
Sorry I meant the participants
Haha, this is awesome, this sub is usually full of terrible stories, it's great to hear a nice one once in a while.
The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.
Yes [NAME] are authoritarian. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre always the ones advocating for bigger government and more government control over everything.
Says one of the two people who keeps on responding to each comment with a very poorly argued position lacking both in research and in common sense.
Nope. Love them. What do you find gross?
He had been so worried that the stepmom would have a hard time integrating into the family.
Totally fair. All I was trying to remind everyone is don't fall in love with your crushes.
And the super rich are still miserable
That fellow sure is one hell of a sweet talker!
That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
I would pay good money to watch [NAME] vs Dr. Now!!!
its like waze but for people in debt
I like it that way :) My point is that you‚Äôre an attention seeker like [NAME]
It's a shame that anyone has to deal with that sort of feeling. I'm sorry that you had a similar experience. No one deserves that.
[NAME] already had that in their comment and I didn't deny it. I guess that level of attention to detail isn't taught at Bellevue Community College.
hmm today i will listen to death and destruction
"The biggest argument on your side is depreciate costs. You could challenge their concern of ""getting fooled"" by getting the car inspected by an independent."
Haha epic gamer moment
Am I wrong? So many people from NY say it's really gone downhill. Doesn't mean I don't like public transportation
I just love the fact that [NAME] is giving advice on Sex offenders
The father clearly ran away lol
Hey bud, I‚Äôd honestly try to complain a little less and I promise you‚Äôll slowly become a happier person
That‚Äôs not the period it‚Äôs referring to
Hey man. A lot of people have criminals in their family. That doesn‚Äôt mean they are I think you need to take a step back
[NAME], buy me dinner before you go to poundtown on us.
Definitely not Mom‚Äôs favorite.
Avoid Blount St and Martin Luthur King or risk death. I‚Äôm not kidding.
Luckiest I‚Äôve been is getting the toy I actually wanted from a McDonald‚Äôs happy meal.
you almost blew my fucking mind there.
I'm glad we have a place we can come to when we have doubts. Thank you so much.
That actually looks so fire
That must have bean awesome to find those
Thank you. I'll definately be sure to pick up that book sometime.
Haha, thanks, bot! How's your day going? ‚ù§Ô∏èüåàüöÄ
My heart is breaking for that little girl.
[NAME] would love [NAME]. [NAME] would hate [NAME].
BREAKING NEWS, local bartender found chained up in drunks basement!
I don‚Äôt think so honestly. He‚Äôs said I‚Äôm cute before last night. It wasn‚Äôt the first time.
Shut the fuck up, loser.
That's how I used to feel but contracting oneitis added a heaping shitpile of loneliness and agony on top
STOP GETTING FACTS FROM [NAME] AND THE CORRUPT STATE ..lol
That was great, especially as your first video.
They just shot up a mall. They‚Äôre complete fucking idiots.
[NAME] is my least favorite on the station.
Congrats on becoming the owner of this cat! What a beautiful meow.
Source each of these and trend lines from previous years please. No, listing a few agencies and telling people to Google 8t isn't a source. 
This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work.
Police can amend docs, they can‚Äôt change them. Even if it‚Äôs a name
the pharma part killed me
It won't be. Just a rumor.
Honestly, Queen kinda sucks. Obvious they were ripping off My Chemical Romance.
oh, ive seen that, ugh breeders have such weird and confusing minds
All I see is a missed opportunity to pet a wolf tummy.
No. That‚Äôs an actually pot plant. You have to do some extra work to keep it blooming each year.
It involves a relationship with a girl so I need a girls input, sorry I‚Äôm not sexist or anything.
"You offered her the wrong ""services"" /s (obviously I hope)"
Good for him, most guys are like [NAME] and would take her back in an instant.
[NAME] can still betabuxx and have an easier life than you will if you have to be alone and support yourself with no help.
You didn't say they were racist channels
Those vast differences don't get noticed by the public.
I'm now scared to post this link]( I guess I should [stop.
I've been twice and both locations had a serious bee problem.
Ah, i misunderstood what he was going for, sorry my bad
Agreed. Reverse the story so that a girl makes her boyfriend shit his pants before going out and suddenly it's funny.
I AM LITERALLY FREAKING THE FUCK OUT
Sodaman going sicko mode
I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
Oh look, it's wr2! *proceeds to get fucked*
this actually made me LOL, thanks
Apparently young children have to figure out breathing through their mouth. I forget at what age that typically occurs, but yeah...
i see it in a different way, but i understand why you see it like that
Now I'm worried that cat will get salmonella :(
Oh god, [NAME] is terrible. My kid loves it though, and Dr [NAME]
You shouldn't have been leaving anyway, witch. Go write a funding bill. You know... do your job.
Thank you for your concern, fellow conservative
Yeah I laughed when I remembered it. Random.
But if [NAME] wins... well, things might change.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need no more sisters, I got enough last year‚Äù *cut to shocked mid drag faces in the werk room*
This sent shivers down my spine
Just wondering how they did it visually with all the fireworks going on
I feel with him...
Well, don't kill spiders. That's what you get. Be nice and take them outside. It's not that hard.
> I hate how much I care. My feelings exactly.
Thank you this is really inspirational
Huh. That‚Äôs kind of crazy.
So upset by the email lady after all these years. Get help.
From where I was it looked like the plane banked right past the 505 on its second pass through downtown. Crazy.
Enjoy a weekend of eating ice cream 100% guilt free. (That's standard practice for wisdom teeth still, right?)
Thanks for the detailed reply friend, much appreciated. I‚Äôm a history buff and love learning about these things.
The QB said they loved it
I like how you have the word idiot in your name. You are sure living up to it
Love the use of ginormous ... so true
She's just going to suck you back in.
The best for a reason.
Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! 
"[NAME] is a 6'5"" [NAME] that can't rebound or defend."
No, I‚Äôm saying that ‚Äúnot getting an abortion‚Äù is the default option, and takes less deliberate effort than getting an abortion.
I WILL NOT OBEY THAT ORDER, GENERAL! 
You forgot our dear friends from Paris
awkward edit - aww are you a rangers fan, damnit
Yeah, 16 yearolds being attracted to other 16 yearolds sure is creepy... 
A fuckin men
Reality is often disappointing
Reddit hates women.
" ""If you don't wear BROWN AND ORANGE...YOU DON'T MATTER!"" We need a tshirt with that on it asap! "
Stop whatever you think is pushing you away. You are the one in control not [NAME].
Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink 
Ah yes that makes sense - the gofundme for her and the workers seems to be taking off at least (if it‚Äôs legit)
god i love [NAME]
I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special 
That‚Äôs sex discrimination. The male class has their own bathrooms but the female does not.
oh right that was a huge leap my bad
Lmao I listen to stuff that doesn't fit in any of these categories Oh, and grandson
Nothing but net. He got a few phone numbers then ghosted lol.
Because he's in dirt, and probably didn't have much practice 
I know this might be an unpopular opinion from reading this post but I have a gut feeling that [NAME] and [NAME] would pair up really well together.
When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.
As I understand it, the director? left so at least if they do reboot it it‚Äôll be in more competent hands lol
[NAME] !!!
High five to that shit. We have 2 littles.....we are also exhausted lol
We can only hope that they will appreciate our sacrifices once they get older!
I was petrified...
thanks you too
Seen as Child abuse in some places. Not illegal but judges hate it. No matter the sex.
I mean the whole discussion is about sales soooo...
Explaining the whole thing i wouldnt have the heart to physically or mebtally hurt a person such as raping someone
Okay thanks for the advice!
One of the comments on that video: ‚ÄúCat: I‚Äôve waited far too long.‚Äù Hahaha
I met her once and she ended up falling for me.
It's not collapsing
What is this an excerpt from? [NAME] was a treasure. I should read more of his stuff.
What a tool!
Thank you good sir! I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing!
thanks! yours inspired my to post mine lol
Ahhhhhhh. The fine talent and craftsmanship of CNN
"I love how the reason for the dislocation got progressively less extreme until the ""I was sitting down"" Man, getting old sucks"
I wouldnt necessarily call you and addict but you definetly have unhealthy relationship with MDMA.
Worst ending ever! I won't spoil it but this one sucked worse than the avengers last movie!
I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around.
Oh man, you got me there with the image
Just imagine Disney characters without gloves. Yes it's that horrifying
Any man who won‚Äôt fight for his kids isn‚Äôt worth your time.
Going from [NAME] to [NAME] on the PP is like going from tenderloin to convenience store hotdogs
Says who? Comedians can joke about anything as long as it's funny to their audience.
That‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôll read it, thanks.
I didn't read that but so what?
Your company sucks.
[NAME] still looks fresh for 40 years old.
I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less than those deplorable traitorous trumptards.
It is so good to hear from you. Stay safe!
Thanks! Sometimes you need an article in order to shake some sense into someone.
Despite how selfish that seems, I respect the honesty. 
[NAME] saved by the very compassion in society that he is trying to destroy.
Scary times we live in.
Our experience was much the same. We might go back for a 2nd chance, but doubtful. The brewery next door was great.
Tbh I've never found the porn ads arousing, I've usually found them annoying, stupid, really clickbaity, or hilariously cheesy
I think it should be a felony. Kind of crazy that illegally entering a country is such a minimal offense.
My man!! You go. That's brilliant. Brightened my day.
Windbreakers, we‚Äôre supposed to wear them when it‚Äôs cold as apparently a joke to keep us warm üôÉ I hate doing drive ups now
One of the gayest shirts I have ever seen...
He looks like [NAME] soooo... accurate.
Sorry to burst your bubble but [NAME] is more popular than [NAME]
lmao yes, my reasoned, supported response to your unfounded criticism is most certainly an example of one of the points the hack artist tried to assert
Bingo! I would not/could not be in a relationship with someone who denies their child a parent by choice.
How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s
They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
Crowder is terrible... How do you lose that gunfight or not have the common sense to just run away
Troo, troo....worse eban dan eat pizza wif aht a ferk. 
Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Enjoy this slice on me üç∞
Yep! And the buns seemed so much fresher then. Last time I went, years ago, it was terribly disappointing.
Money can‚Äôt buy happiness, but it can make getting there a hell of a lot easier.
There would be a lot of sexual tension in faze...
wow just shows how confused **I** was Ftfy Pretty fucking clear as day what was going on here lol I honestly don't know what to tell you
Sorry if this is ignorant but is that a wig?
Animal Crossing made my wife into a vicious and abusive murderer.
Fun game. Good expansion too
Haha, only one species. More the Cockatoos
Sorry I was being facetious
Enthusiasm is not helpful, got it. Edit: lol what a bunch of snowflakes.
Hence what I said, it is just as illegal yesterday as it is today ... literally nothing changed 
it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
Some people have thin skin and are unequipped with dealing with backlash.
but that‚Äôs exactly my point lol you get better at those things, the scary factor affecting skill learning becomes smaller and smaller
Real nice, swearing up a storm right in front of your kids.
i wish it was 2 hours :(
Sorry that's a mistype. I mean equally irresponsible
I feel like [NAME] was impossibly bad enough to warrant memes about him. [NAME] is just bad, boring, and too invisible to really hate.
And then attacking you as a person when you say you'd prefer not to be stalked and murdered. Sorry but your friend is a problem.
I remember your story. Like you, I'm not as active. And also like you, I try and come back and give folks here hope.
We had a baby, it's hard to find the time to take them down.
Astonishing. I've read about these people but have never met one. I am so relieved for you that she is out of your life.
you are pathetic.
Well Played
The Coming Home Network. And [NAME] is a convert who has really good books.
I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?
You have my support.
I graduated in 2002 and had history books that ended with [NAME] 2nd term. I had great teachers but terrible materials.
THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!
We're not roasting you. That's not how it works here. Go get help and feel better then come back for proper roasting.
How many wins do you got like 200 lol
I didn't mean the entire show is shit. I meant that season 4 was a shitshow.
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
ah yes because that is exactly what has happened in mainstream politics.
You look Beautiful! Curls are wonderful!
Does anybody ever tell you guys that you're doing a good job? Because they should. You're doing a good job.
If he doesn‚Äôt respond, then you‚Äôre too good for him
What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person‚Äôs looks and not at all their personality?
weird how they feel the need to announce themselves
A shame our driver education programs in the U.S. are pretty much a joke as compared to those in Germany.
sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.
Ive just given up. Learning to become selfish.
I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
I remember thinking how smart I was then. /s
Fuck why didn‚Äôt I think of that
he ignored a question I asked him as well he is not big into responding.
That‚Äôd be amazing
Explaines Why I‚Äôm on the lookout for cats when I‚Äôm anxious! Thanks
> I really hope QCX addresses that last point. Who knows [NAME] could've fled with the money or something. What the hell dude. lol
Your title is unnecessarily harsh towards the user. Re-submit with a better title.
Are you really Belgian cause I love it
Like women don‚Äôt have enough things to be judged on, now everyone is talking about our eyebrows..this is the most ridiculous trend to me. 
Japan uses anime for it all, but it does often prefix it with something like kaigai. (outside of the country).
EO here. This is correct. It's folk theology, popular with some, but is certainly not dogma.
See this is why they should merge r/forhonor and r/forhonormemes cause clearly it makes no difference what subreddit it‚Äôs on
We need more people like you. We need a batman who specifically harasses fat people.
If your team has no healer I really hope u get the heal talent
Funny how it do
Absolutely insane documentary. I actually thought it was a parody at one point but it‚Äôs all real.
You suck at trolling. It's way too obvious.
of course not, [NAME] and [NAME] were great friends and anyway, he's been dead since 2016.
"Oh damn, that would have been the only correct response! ""Sorry, but I have a boyfriend."" End of conversation."
Same thing with Urgot mid. It looks absolutely trash even in LCK.
I agree with the last part. Stop getting stopgaps and sign [NAME]...
I'm glad you're doing a bit better. Sorry about your grandma. Good luck.
I've never been more disturbed by a dog
I wish this was animated.
Fourth guy had nice hair though tbh
Very good! Now run along little boy. Shew! Fft!
At least the crazy lady didn't hunt ya down mate!
Cursed image.
I don't really want to do anything.
Because its the internet and people are bored. Its not kids, its full grown adults and you know it. Unbunch your panties.
Nailed it !
This sounds like borderline mental health issues. Scary.
Nice job continuing to ignore the fact she lost her home and her father at the peak of the 2008 housing crisis you obtuse prick
Same. Wasn't good enough. Left broken. Edit: more broken
Ah, I remember the first time I got scope bite, we all had a good laugh and I got glass in my eye
Yeah I don't mind the odd hunter or a daddy long legs but fuck those red backs. And whitetails Those cunts are vicious as all hell
2 2nd rounders but not a first or a future first. He‚Äôs not worth the risk
Yep, the presidency isn‚Äôt at all related to the 22nd amendment. Be gone, chud.
[NAME] damn it
Because it was funny and people liked it. They otherwise do a pretty job of preventing memery
[NAME], [get_user_id] is a moron.
I love you too, no homo.
Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I‚Äôm sorry. 
Fuck man I didn‚Äôt plan on crying in my cube today
Me too! First time in a couple of years!
Dammit, [NAME]! You're only hurting hardworking doggos with this shutdown!
For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome 
So fucking awesome. Cheers from Brazil.
Considering that was a very early episode of SU, making tall trans women feel good is awesome :D
trashy comment.
I pray this changes.
just noticed, lol. damn pervert foreigners.
That looks righteous!!
üòÄahhh I see what you did there, clever.
Cool have fun
I can see the rippled sandy bottom, the shark is clearly visible, the surface is near. I feel ok üòÅ
What a legend. True spidey meme master
A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He‚Äôs likely talking about alcohol anyway.
OH NO! LOL That'll teach ya, kid. 
I‚Äôd buy a cheap version of it.
So do I. But you can't just blame it all on the dude.
Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech
I‚Äôm uncomfortable just looking at her.
That‚Äôs cool. I didn‚Äôt know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
BANG motherfucker!
use this to make you aim better than my bad aim :)
There‚Äôs no way this gets signed, right? Is it just lip service?
Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
No, he's told me on multiple occasions he hates anime
Thank you so much. ‚ô•Ô∏è that means a lot.
Ugh. Sounds awful. I‚Äôm sorry :(
I was thinking it‚Äôs sad that a team that hasn‚Äôt had a FRP for what seems like a decade has a better record than us.
That's bad
This is giving me so much life.
[NAME] learned to fight smarter, not harder. I love her development so much
cheers to everyone who voted for me; i love all you guys!! here's to another great year of memes and laughs!
Ah. Yea, the classic loner looking for compliments. Seems pretty edgy
Get out asap.
Hope you will beat this crap and achieve your full potential man. Best of luck for you :)
Yeah, but nobody takes McD's hamburgers seriously. 
Oh I see...I keep trying to do the move everytime they're down. Thanks for the clarification.
They look incredibly legal, organized, and accurate, just like yours! 
Downvote me into oblivion but both [NAME] and [NAME] shot around 35%. However one they say he balled out and the other one was struggling.
WHAT?! You dare insult the band of gods?! Typical teen, I hate my own generation! *screams in 16 year old*
If only I could bake a cake...or do anything productive when I'm feeling low confidence. I just lay in my bed and stop moving.
"& when you call them on their shit they ban you from their subreddit for ""oppressing people"""
I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
Plz add ye and ksg. Thanks, ye
thank you! he‚Äôs a boob and his wife is a fool...
A work on yourself to change these issues. Or live a life without close connections. At the end of the day its depends on which you want.
> If you have a point - make it. I did, I'm sorry you missed it.
Thank you so much! This summarizes a lot!
Thanks Mate. [NAME] is awesome
Im more impressed with the non-toxic team work! Good job!
Spoken like proud slaughter-bound crotch fruit!
I just don‚Äôt like him üòÇ
No, but I might choose to not support certain teams because their owners are trash.
I really wish I could do that. The furniture is all made from my grandfather so I don't want to get rid of it. :(
No I didn't take it that way. My apologies if my comment appeared to be taking a shot at you.
Im sorry dude. Drumming Octopuss.
Even the worst pyramid scheme pays out something.
Obviously, it was a humorous comment. But I'm pretty sure I can guess what you voted :P
Thanks! I love watching him every week
I love the burn
What the hell- they're paying for cars they don't and won't ever own?!
Yeah that's funny. Girl who didn't like that is probably some [NAME] wannabe thot.
Then getafe should have gotten their first goal. Ref is really bad.
Can't fire everyone if everyone is on strike.
Thanks for that..
Skypeia in One Piece has literally nothing to do with the main plot but I loved it. It also gave us the single greatest reaction image.
Damn! I hadn‚Äôt heard about the eBay stuff.
Sorry man. Didn't realize I was talking to a Russian spam bot. Please give my best to [NAME].
You really should not group people with ones you have had bad experiences it will not help you grow
I would suffer a heat stroke or die of diarrhea
I love the immediate cut from the gladiator dying to the defeat screen. Makes it funnier
Well you‚Äôll have a lot more fun for these matchups. Can‚Äôt say much for the rest of the season
So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :(
Damn, I'd better avoid you then. I don't wanna die.
I low-key love his YT channel, he's genuinely an interesting and good person
You are too nice. That guys angry he loses to wardens all the time.
That has nothing whatsoever to do with what I was talking about.
He, like [NAME] and [NAME], are better in the latter halves of seasons. Let's see if he can do some damage.
I can understand political acrimony but the death of humor is really disappointing. Very sad indeed.
When ever I‚Äôm feeling depressed or alone, I‚Äôll just image you and think ‚Äúit could be worse‚Äù.
Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
Hope she can do twice a week, that ought to be persuasive.
Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
Until you provide a valid source nobody cares what your theory is. So it's downvoted.
Interesting that these two have made such a splash. I might check into this season if it's worth watching.
It literally never occurred to me that there would be a sub for USAJOBS. Thank you so much
Welcome <3
Ding Ding Ding, exactly where I called BS
hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes.
It was the worst cinemax porn I've ever seen.
That was glorious.
Yea I'm poor :(
I‚Äôm gonna need a couple more checks before I trade down for a retarded kid.
I merely suggested he see a doctor based on some weird symptoms he is having that cause him to not be able to interact with others very well.
I‚Äôm to scared to tell them :(
This seemed so out of character but I was like cool. Weird.
Holy shit that was fucking bad...
>Yes, I know that you like to talk about yourself a lot :P I do use a lot of words. It's actually embarrassing. 
You‚Äôre the one who is stupid
Who is bored? I happily entertain myself.
although he is best girl, he can never love :( he litterally doesn't have a heart
....that's *naivet√©*, break the cycle... ## DONT BE NEGATIVE 3.0
I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. I‚Äôm glad you got out of it.
Yes I really miss his streams...the ONLY reason I chose adc as my main role was because of how chill chaox was.
that's hysterical. two legitimate babes.
There is going to be an adjustment period at first for sure, but [NAME] would definitely help our defense.
Never listen to songs with someone you love. Just don't. Trust me.
Locking a bunch in a kids in a room with their pedophile priest is fun af? You need help.
I'm not sure what you are implying, but it seems very rude.
I liked the Celtics until I started following barstool.
Coming from [NAME] even though it‚Äôs a hypothetical question it‚Äôs still gotta feel scary
Nice ovation when he first checked in and after the tribute video. Also made some noise when he hit a 3 late.
People are still playing bf1?Wow thats nice,I should play some games until more content drops for bf5.
What a REPOST! STOP REPOSTING THINGS PEOPLE LITERALLY JUST POSTED.
Raw, unfiltered athleticism...whoops wrong player *puts down [NAME] player card* A real hard worker...could date the coach's daughter
[NAME] has to use a gun to defend himself after multiple robberies and an attempted rape...
Then your education must have been pretty poor lol
Sounds racist, fetishistic, sexist, and objectifying.
Fuuuck, brutal
i feel like this isn't being talked about enough.
Thankkks and np
one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!
He is a moron.
I used to have anxiety when calling people but I no longer have them at least just 20-30% anxiety.
Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
Gamers know all too well how it feels to be oppressed by society.
This guy has the charisma and sex appeal of overcooked noodles.
It's a Falling In Reverse song, which makes it even more terrifying
San Junipero. What if old ladies could fuck, using the Matrix!?
Never said that. Not once. Punishment isn‚Äôt slavery. Unless you‚Äôd rather just kill lawbreakers
You look like [NAME] from firefly :)
You don't get it man
How can they expect you to write if you can't read? /s
The menzingers are sick, good luck out there bud
Ugh this moment really had me crying lol just hearing him remember all the good I was like WHY
I don't think fantasy draft has been a thing for a few years in career mode.
I appreciate your honesty.
Lol. Build your own or make some tweaks to the printer.
Dude, it made *me* reflect a little. Side note, what a wonderful username.
The people you know have silly opinions. Its their best album since black holes.
That‚Äôs not true. She represents those who voted her into power.
Naah, [NAME] fans got depressed when [NAME] didn't die
Growing up there were people in our church who hated the Smurfs because they were magic using communists.
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.
[NAME] is bad & anyone who still supports him should feel bad for it.
Awesome and interesting response!
This has the makings of a great painting.
Are ya completely sure that's not from that Thursday last summer?
"I guess we didn't truly ""match"" but I saw the profile with the percentage of their calculated compatibility."
Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.
So glad my mom didn‚Äôt act this way when I was diagnosed.... oh, and my mom was smart and vaccinated me
Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens.
"And lo, for he took to Facebook and quoth righteousness, and the people were joyful, and gave unto him many ""likes."""
I AM THE RED ONE THANK YOU
No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
"I'm just gonna hit ""back"" now. See you guys."
Seeing [NAME] on Sunday and I'm so fucking stoked
Love it.
You can't buy a toe line.
Hi !! I totally get you. If you want to be friends I‚Äôm here !! :)
That's awesome, good for you! This sub needs wayyy more posts like this. 
No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
Thanks for the gold
I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes.
BP can bulwark counter A good number of deflects and even drop attacks We have more than that to worry about
Take a break then get back out there!
I guess a little research goes a long way. [NAME] is the last speaker with the 20 dollar example. Stay strong all!
Zionism is the ISIS of [RELIGION]. Brainwashed idiots like ISIS.
Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that‚Äôs the sad part
Cali is getting rain this weekend so going to miss that
If I tried that I would lose badly, get laughed at, and be back at square one.
We need an irbe so bad right now. I hope [NAME] is that guy
I have but one upvote to give, otherwise you would get more.
"Little kids are the best because they're just like ""Wtf?!?!?"""""
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.
You bet, sweetie ;) But I date girls so don't get too excited <3
I don't think you could actually find something that's *unambiguously* racist. That's just how dog whistles work.
Might do that, thank you!
*what the fuck*
was that hutty from [NAME]?? ahhh that makes me so happy. love those boys e: oh it was a rebound
I was really hoping Vikings would get a bear mask but this also looks sick! RIP all my steel
I love when [NAME] loses the ball then jogs back on defense
They ate not hot, they are just annoyingly humid.
If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.
No... that's literally our first rule.
Yeah but FGM is basically like cutting off the head of the penis entirely. I'm uncut myself but I get why people do it
I love you more
It‚Äôs one of my worst nightmares to have skin like that...I hope that person gets actual help
They wont investigate cause the damage isn't worth $1000+
I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy.
Just don't stop with the damn good cooking though please lol.
I want to give my peers money, so they can fight for my rights and privilges- see the bus pass discussion in this thread. 
Nah. Mine was wrapped around my neck and I am a gun loving medical student.
Ohhhhh man, too real. I spent way too many years with full on raccoon eyes and just accepting that's what makeup was.
He's not had a great season but Athletic in general has been a shitshow this season (and last) so no real surprise there.
That's not true! Some of them are probably into watersports.
"Its a mandatory requirement to be an accredited ""[NAME] da"""
The cutest.
*Googles what is the third leading cause of death* Google *updated*: Measles causes by stupid people not vaccinating their children
Well then his whole argument is a straw man itself, because nobody advocates abortions of fully formed babies
This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
No it wouldn't you dumbass
Thank you. Posted this to Facebook!
I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.
this aint it chief
I'm about 5 weeks of NC after a 1 yr relationship. It gets better. Occupy and work on yourself.
I feel personally attacked on this one. We're good people... : (
 anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad.
To be fair that would be a hella stiff drink.
your first mistake was trying to make something look presentable while serving it in a tupperware
Right? I'd launch myself at him. Beautiful looking guy. <3
Ah, victory 
If it‚Äôs weed I‚Äôm going to be disappointed. Can‚Äôt we all just go to the store and get it?
Just because you lack critical thinking and reading skills doesnt mean i am a moron, it means you need to learn how to think for yourself.
Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?
i used to do this a lot when i was younger lmao glad to see my vision wasnt just mine
This is why I love Reddit.
Props to this guy, that was an amazing comment. 
Cool. Thanks for the tips!
I'll try to stay patient.
"TTs have size limits. The group I was acquainted with had, ahem, ""leadership"" problems as well."
It's in my top 3 songs, with heard em say, and through the wire. Such great tracks
this is my new favorite phrasing. I've been calling it bingemas since about mid-December.
Nope. Not how things are done around here.
You honestly think a law did away with straw purchases? Stop lying.
I got so high someone from the future stopped me from getting high.
Im definitely gonna check the bushes around the burn where everyone throws their targets from now on. Im not over it i feel bad man.
[NAME] has become the best houseguest ever in 24 hours. We aren‚Äôt worthy
it‚Äôs what i would have wanted if i was a parent so yeah i‚Äôm glad i did something
What a (morbid) analogy - I like it!
Jokes about [NAME] hopefully being in MK11
Great hand eye coordination and speed. Reads the plays in the D zone very well.
i feel like [NAME] doesn't fit with the rest
Because nothing he says was remotely sexist? Sure it could have escalated but what he said was pretty tame.
I‚Äôm an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.
Thanks, that was a big help. This one had me scratching my head 
Considering my wife barely touches me, I think I could get this job. Wonder how much it pays. 
Don't do #4 it's bullshit
Your Beauty shines out of you, than you for this lovely post.
The Cavs didn‚Äôt even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
That makes perfect sense! Thank you for explaining in a way that doesn't try to make me feel stupid for not knowing the answer.
Going through the same thing and I feel the same way. Sadness. I hope it'll pass!
LOL to your family
I know they finally gave Return of the King best Pic but my favorite out of the three was Two Towers. They are all great though.
Oh man I feel bad now. If you find it funny than it's funny üíñ sorry
Awesome!! Also, I have those same markers!
Who is brainwashing people to believe it's all a social construct ? It's really frightening that it's become so mainstream.
He can do a balloon party with his brony friends
I kinda feel like you may be my auntie. Florida?
[NAME] investigation has already paid for itself thanks to Manafort. Try harder.
It had bad spelling but i understood it u grammqr nazi
I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
And once NYC is finally underwater, ALBANY SHALL RISE!!! MORE COAL FOR THE FIRE JETHRO, OUR DESTINY AWAITS!!!
Thank you.. Yeah if she just want to talk she is definitely wasting my time.
*Ugh..* You are 23 and not married - leave.
This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
Haha I should probably clarify it was family owned and managed
I think some idiotic members are extremist, but for the most part they just hate mass unchecked immigration.
I know you can‚Äôt read this, but I feel really bad and hope you learn to read soon 
Awesome; two steps back then one forward; so many big devs these days.
Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway...
This should be interesting...
üôÑ i hate these people.
I like your rant.
Good news: this is shark tale not finding Nemo
Finally, one win for the war on drugs!
Congrats! Vegan baking is still daunting to me but I will conquer it one day!
I might be in trouble in this case. I have 7 years going on 8 :(
I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit. My country is a laughing stock right now. 
Thanks a ton again, and honeslty haha im so ready to get out and have my own life for once
Hey! Go fuck yourself, you capitalist apologist bootlicking piece of shit
I will be definitely doing this now. We have a meeting next week, so I will be sure to bring this up. Thanks!
But it'll hurt
[NAME] has an amazing track record. I think some people forget how innovative and unpredictable the [NAME] era offense was.
>not a cure-all. Since we don't have such a thing, is this not the next best option?
Nice to see a rare court case involving a meta-human.
Hi! :) Because I am broke, I guess.
But really Vanilla Ice is scum RIP [NAME] and [NAME]
Agreed, my guy.
Look at it this way: it's the Millennium Falcon, everyone still loves it. It's part of it's charm.
Reddit culture is truly the worst.
Season 2 has been fantastic
good lookin out bro
No. That is creepy and weird. If you don‚Äôt trust her .... move on.
~~Comrade~~ [NAME] I'm appalled that you would accuse me of using performance enhancing drugs. Neigh! Neigh I say!
"He may have, I was more worried about the ""running and shooting the AR one handed, off to the side""."
If [NAME] gets 350M+ from anyone we should be glad we didn't get him.
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm my opinion it isn‚Äôt sweet. 
[NAME] looks queasy already I like where this is going
That guy is an actor. Forgot his name but he's in imdb, played small roles. 
Super creepy. And leaving the note is out of line
we are at !CURSED! levels of cursed
I made a post about a month ago saying [NAME] was trash and it got over 100 downvotes
I liked the edgy sexual attraction. It was intense and I was drunk on it.
You can get so much money from hunting. Fishing is probably the best method if you‚Äôre grinding but I actually enjoy hunting
I didn‚Äôt know that. Gtk
Aha! This is my fear, that the gloss over key elements because they want to target a wider audience!
When I see [NAME] venerate icons it makes you wonder if they have OCD. /s The joke is that [NAME] cross themselves more than others in my experience.
I love [NAME] comedy. I hope she makes another show.
Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers
The sad truth is that all the feelings you get are real and genuine in that moment
Wishing you all of the best friend !!!!
The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
hope [NAME] is injured while allstar week yes im a spiteful ngga
Thats a meme? That feels more like depression
Minimum wage hurts small business more than it helps the poor.
I hope he loses just the end so it looks like a trimmed cigar
Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions, let's try to not resort to name calling no matter how much we disagree
> Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up
Bravo! It's hard saying you need help, and sometimes even harder accepting it. So proud of you momma!
I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
This can be taken horribly out of context
I‚Äôm actually not! From USA, sadly. üôÉ Edited to add: unless you didn‚Äôt mean me, then I apologize! 
Time consuming too, but buying a box that size outright is stupidly expensive‚Äîeven if you order a bundle of 25 at a time.
so fucking beautiful. so subtle, but so necessary.
Now this is a Contrapoints video I want to see
I did this a couple years back. Daily binged on Simpsons. So Good.
lol [NAME] trying to attack someone with their back turned
It was. I accept that, and it taught me a valuable lesson.
You are the only real person i can look at soo noo
It‚Äôs a smart move but also hurts the business and possibly false. It‚Äôs rude.
Where? Sorry, the link doesn't seem to work!
Genuinely laughed really hard
I understand that there are exceptions but saying a knife is as dangerous as, or more dangerous than a gun is a little ridiculous.
Worse. They told us to mind our own business
Until we win an actual SuperBowl trophy I want all the positive karma.
A few years ago a lot of shows tried to do a ‚Äúsecond screen experience‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt work and died a quiet death.
Wow! That's too real, it touched me! Nice work :D
Im glad [NAME] was there for us
I can't believe that we've seen this ep before and missed the poster. Wish I could upvote y more than once.
Good suggestion, he does a great job guarding [NAME] in their matchups
Maybe because [NAME] didn't actually made a joke, he just pretended to be stupid
That book would be the biggest flop, the characters and plot are really too outrageous to be believable.
Its to bad he doesn‚Äôt give Tomlin this treatment.
Alright, thanks. I appreciate you taking your time to explain that to me. 
That's cute
I was sad when the Hawks lost [NAME] but this Schottenheimer guy seems pretty cool.
[NAME] killed him and was only in for like 5 minutes...
Nice strawman. I can see now that you're not compensating for anything, lol. 
What the heck?!
Tbh, 2020 he would give us another amazing album. This year could still be rushed, but it‚Äôs great to see him out and shit
> Consult /r/ssbbw (NSFW) for a better answer. Thanks. But no thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Nae bother, Happy to bring musical joy in to any household.....
[NAME], I hope your plot armor is strong enough to save [NAME] from a ship crash.
Oof, that was efficient 
These aren‚Äôt /u/ These are just their nicknames. They‚Äôll know who they are when they read it and that‚Äôs what matters.
Oh [NAME] this is atrocious... I think I'm in love
Doubt [NAME] will solve our problems
Mate you're talking to a Remainer who wants to Remain... I just want a Labour Government that's all.
No worries, glad I could help. Just pleased I started learning to read!
Lol so petty, I kinda love it. I probably wouldn‚Äôt actually do that but it‚Äôs tempting.
Just life.. I feel like i'm just a parasite that should be removed.
Lol he did didn't he. Sounds like a race to the bottom.. filled with cockends
your post is awesome. People need to hear this more. Thank you.
Trust me, I'd love to have foreskin but there's some sort of weird thing going on here involving circumcision.
"[NAME]: ""She seems useless"""
One of my biggest regrets is that I never got to see [NAME] in person. Incredibly talented and the league is clearly better off for it.
Ah I didn‚Äôt think of that second definition of end. I like it!
Great album! üëä
Just found UPPERROOM a few months ago and really love them! All the rest are staples in my playlists too!!!
My goodness I didn't even know this existed. This is my first time seeing something like this. Pretty cool stuff.
Fuck your husband
I‚Äôd be afraid to get high after that yo
Debs a bitch
You people really overestimate how much welfare actually covers. You act like one child is making six figures and giving their entire family an MTV Cribs lifestyle.
Well that escalated quickly.
She want to take it slow, I can see that... I deal with those girls all the time, they my favorite 
proper fucking order
They're wrong, it was due to their natural wetland habitats being degraded & drying out. 
I am almost there... I am daddy cute now.. almost silver fox.
Everyone loved the Snacks trade.
Keep it simple. Do what makes the money so you can go do what you want.
He's likeable but the pace of a game on live tv is too much for him. He'd definitely be better suited as a halftime guy
I agree, it would be a bore if everybody agreed with everyone else. 
I would do that, but I put them all on 0 hour contracts and less than minimum wage and I don‚Äôt want to pay them. 
Sorry, didnt realize. Anyway an r/woooosh so...
West Hartford, CT. Unfortunately it's not religious. Thank you for the response.
Holiday getting abused as usual
[NAME] looks like [NAME] gorgeous
I was grouping twitter with it. Tweets were great this year
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good
An angry old person yelling at a retail worker will never listen to reason.
because energy drinks are the most fucked up you can get while still being sober
Pretty sure we‚Äôre the ones being carried with no thunderlords...smh.
Loved that show, but [NAME] put me right off it. Like fingernails down a chalk board.
Arghh! There's a dinosaur loose in your house! A dinosaur with Tippex eyes.
Imagine if we dont trade [NAME] and [NAME] fans just kill all of us.
MOTHERFUCKING FLYING MONKEYS, AHHHHHHHHGHGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
ü§£ wow... I read it all in a serious tone until the end! ü§£
So sorry to hear that matey. What a good dog. Give him lots of pets.
Don‚Äôt ever play poker! Lol
Yeah. Sure.... Why don‚Äôt you just let us have some fun, wet towel person.
I'm very much like that, here's my face lol You're either interested or you're not
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. "
That's just reckless. He's lucky he didn't get permanently disfigured or killed.
Wow. I hope that asst manager will be looking for a new job soon.
We don't deserves horses
[NAME] pnr play has not been good, they are defending jok and letting him get to the rim
Yes, it's normal. More like considering you options than desperation
my crush began to be annoying when i lost interest in him. it sucks either way
This keeps getting posted. I think not
You know, I was wrong. I always assumed false dichotomy was their favorite fallacy when it's clearly strawman.
Wow... congrats
I really appreciate this post. I have been having a shit day and this honestly made my night!
I agree i think it's a problem with inner game even when i get the number she don't answer
They‚Äôre also communist, so that puts them above their reproach
I'm sorry that I pay for music now to support these small artists. I know I'm a monster but I will try to be better.
Œî sorry I completely forgot about these, but yeah you definitely changed my view 
No longer in LA but I really hope he can get reelected!
Bioavailability is poor without an emulsifier, this is not a practical method of administration.
Aye but happy cake day mate.
This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually.
I read that too and was nowhere near as useful as being that valuable.
Oh fuck off. Soooo...... when is [NAME] and the gang going to un mask [NAME] as President [NAME]?
Oh man. GOOD one.
I feel like I'm in a yoghurt advertisement announcing how my digestive system is all rejuvenated. Its that wholesome.
I'm giving you an upvote for that perfect comeback, but I'm not happy about it!
I also take the pill continuously for endometriosis. I will never go back. I love those pills.
I hated him too, just keep watching. Every character has their own personal journey which is such an admirable aspect of this show.
Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
[NAME] and the Chicago Wolves (I'm so sorry)
I really don't like the way she says zombie. It sounds like she tryed to fill up space.
Because it's incredibly cringy.
Thank you!! I‚Äôm at home recovering from surgery and on some meds, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I imagined it. 
that's not scarcity its desperation and prioritizing looks over everything else
No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you
It‚Äôs been 2 hours, OP died for a noble cause.
Maybe he just never wanted to be a head coach and was content with being a defensive coordinator? Either way, I‚Äôm excited!
That‚Äôs great of you :)
It‚Äôs got to be embarrassing at this point
I just hope [NAME] doesn't lose hope. Dudes got a great heart. But knowing our organization...
I have this problem but without caffeine
Newsflash: Ugly people cheat, too. Cheaters cheat. Cheating is a behavior, not a look. 
??? Where the hell is this article getting it's data from...
What an obnoxious, drunk girl. 
Depends on what's causing the hallucinations
They apologized for that episode.
i mean i hate these takes that because we turned the ball over 26 times, the rotations werent a problem. They clearly were
Don't care. Have fun. Got better things to do.
I like your style B)
I have never seen a dog more excited than when a sled dog is about to go to work.
WE LIKE SPORTZ AND WE DON‚ÄôT CARE WHO KNOWS
Lol idk how he messed them up but they were like eating rubber or gummy candies almost
I don't know what's more embarrassing, the fact I watch the show or own a Roku TV.
[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
Watch out, [NAME]!! [NAME] is right behind you. Oh god oh fuck he can‚Äôt hear us, he has AirPods.
sorry I dont understand, I dont keep up with celebrity gossip, was [NAME] involved in something [NAME] related?
I hope thats true.
Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
I‚Äôm not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.
oh man that actually sounds gross in that context
All the people who got on at canning bridge station this morning and kept pushing and shoving each other like animals.
Valid. That shit right there is valid as hell.
212/62 actually, lol. Good to know it's a metro-wide issue!
Such nice, silly, warm friends once you get to know how to act near one. You have to learn the secret scratchy place too!
That is the first positive thing I‚Äôve ever read about NJ transit.
I think [NAME] has a pretty unconventional face, also [NAME]
We had fantastic spacing that possession. Clearing all the defenders to the left side of the court so that [NAME] had a completely open lane to the basket.
That's why I don't open Instagram that much
I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
That's right, always be extra careful around the corner.
I‚Äôm just afraid of the reaction. But I know you‚Äôre right.
interesting theory. I'll try to keep this in mind more. ‚ô•
Honestly this type of support sounds very shallow. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre gonna support women in any way when their babies are born.
To me the toenails is the grossest part! ü§Æ
$70... Now that's a good price!
People requesting asylum are not illegal immigrants so that argument is bull shit. Get informed by an actual news source please
Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not so smart‚Äô Wow what a murder /s Trash post
satisfying, really.
Sick comeback. Not really a dirty combo other than the unblockable.
My point is that they give him shit for legitimate reasons.
Hahaha! Yes.
"The ""[NAME] says it's true"" line makes me think he's messing with you."
Got one, it's still bad dude
How dare you do [NAME] like this.
Ah the high life. Must be sweet.
No Brexit is also an option.
Stargazing with Vi is definitely my favorite moment of the season so far
"""Time heals all wounds. Give time time."" Best of luck to you."
Stay strong.
Hahaha this is great! What episode/season is this?
Yeah, I do. I'm just pretty sure that that will fuck my heart eventually. But I'll worry about that later.
Yea it's pretty fantastic. I got lucky that despite being fairly TBM she enjoys passionate, frequent sex.
This sounds like revenge, not karma.
Like....what even is the purpose of that lie? Ahaha
Now if you can teach her english, the real fun starts. 
I would like to see the after justice of idiots like this
This post is SO HELPFUL. Thank you!!
Thanks for the resources!
That's not what follows from that at all.
Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear
Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.
I started the Kitty City Meowboys and I do those things. I have a mic but I don't use it because talking exhausts me
Fcuk you.
Because Warlord actually has NO moveset at all and is literally the most boring videogame char to play.
Lmao ‚Äúnow everyone *has* a job‚Äù
Oh well I guess. Can't blame you for that. We aren't all [NAME] though.
[NAME] gotta fix his free throws this is ridiculous
Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
There is obviously love here. Don‚Äôt give up. Talk to each other.
Yeha he failed to qualify unfortnatwly.
Kill me, [NAME] 
It feels like it plays worse tbh
I did not even realize he was injured...
That‚Äôs how it be
She's doing so good!!! I'm rooting for her hardcore!! I like her.
I am really disappointed in everyone today. Not a single murmur was mentioned. People only murmur in [NAME] world.
He rambles like a lunatic and she focuses on being called ‚Äúnot beautiful‚Äù of all things. Lol Uh oh I hear the downvote train a-comin‚Äô!
Yea ur right on that but that doesn't really negate my statement on the blitz.
I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.
Thanks man, likewise for you
In the worst of the anger phase I took up running. It‚Äôs hard to stay in that state while your legs are burning that much.
Probably but if we spread the word, hopefully we will get some people on there
Guys, even worse: He *paid* someone to set it up. Wow. 
[NAME]: I just want them to get things going. [NAME]: This is the competition!
I have no clue what that is, but I hope you have fun
Soooo difficult to do.
The Vikings....they make me the most angry.
From his username I can tell he lives in a city close to me. I'm sorry everyone, Vermont has better to offer than the likes of him
this is so unbelievably adorable
I feel for you (at a title 1 middle school in lausd) I had a tough day today and reading this made me feel a little better ‚úäüèº
You‚Äôre a badass for recognizing this!! Props to you!
I miss SFist's Apartment Sadness column.
Shut up nerd
Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
And yes I also thought [NAME] was someone else too!
"Without Googling it? Are you kidding? (Please don't look up ""kidding"" in the dictionary.)"
She could and should pursue modeling! It seemed like every time she was on screen, my sister and I were saying how effortlessly beautiful she is!!
Wiggs stop that thing you do with your tongue man.
Oh no my jimmies are so rustled! Please desist your relentless banter!
im still starving
congratulations :o)
Our road still hasn‚Äôt been salted on Troy Hill
I miss rock fest üòî
Proud of my Senator today
"Thanks and what even mean ""nobs""? "
Incels dont get laid regardless of age limits. Sorry dude
omg, poor little bean 
If my team lost like that, I‚Äôd definitely be very upset. Just hard to see it.
Doesn't matter what we do. The announcers will trash the Wolves and praise the Lakers. I miss [NAME] and [NAME].
No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
Sadly, that‚Äôs not the interpretation that many elders in your church have made. See: the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Abuse. :(
they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do
We're entitled to express our opinion that OP's opinion is shit.
Loved dropping in from the crack in the ceiling and going out in a blaze of glory.
Well, i was hoping it didn't run flat.
I‚Äôve never heard of this before. That‚Äôs awful.
Not a good couple hours. A full 33 days.
If you‚Äôre downloading from windows I believe so
These are great
Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad.
No thanks, I would prefer to not get infested with malware. 
Ahhh more and more selfish
Thanks ! so need to try a donair sounds amazing
Go to highschool with the guys I went with. You'll get the hang of it in no time..
No. Not the I. :(
"It saddens me that [NAME] legacy has become ""Posterboy for edgy manchilds"""
He might be happy to discover that he is the father of someone with superpowers! LOL
I love the smell of Napalm in the morning
You are ok.
I Will as soon as I get out of The mental hospital lol thank you for recommending it. I love [NAME]
Why is it so hard for people to accept the word no? Jfc. She definitely deserved what she got lol.
You don't need to screw your face up like that, it's already screwed up enough.
This is badass. I'd love to see it placed over war pigs. Amazing work OP
I hear the ruler's control is remote and is viewed with great reception.
This article gives the details
fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city.
True story? Haha
That's true.
And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
"This is so crazy pessimistic. A generic [NAME] will win with plenty of room to spare, the problem is that ""generic"" candidates don't exist"
You'll be okay. Just remember that none of that was real, and that nobody knows. Been there so many times. Hang in there.
Get in touch with a lawyer. No one in Reddit can answer this. Throwing her out really would be better.
I just have a controller on my desk that I turn on when I fly. I've always hated mouse flying.
You basically already know the entire series for how much they've talked about it and how brazenly they spoil it.
Unnecessary. This was painfully obvious
I consider everyone attractive in their own way, so everyone is intimidating.
I schedule reading breaks during the day. It allows me time to relax if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, but is still beneficial for the kids. 
I don't think you understand that the average player can't aim like that on console
Stupid sexy squidward
That might be the prettiest shot I've ever seen [NAME] make.
You're setting the bar awfully low for yourself.
Well that sucks
Sharing with 3 other people was the worst part of hospital for me, fine in the daytime but at night I was barely able to sleep. 
Dude wtf that was definitely off Brooklyn
I see - thank you for the insight.
You‚Äôre an angry elf
Why are you sorry for your grandma? She did what she had to do in order to get what she had paid for.
The titles of her posts are somewhat dramatic and I have avoided her because of that
I could drive my fucking van through there!
Thank god, you're right. At least this idiocy didn't stick around long.
Oh good! Yeah hard to pick up on sarcasm sometimes
a butt ....hahahahahahaha ......every 4th grader ever
The dryer sounds like a fire hazard to me.
stop hurting my feelings
I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
Have them put out a Linux client and I'll be happy to give them a try.
Yo you USA? I‚Äôm on pc and want some people to play bo3 with.
Society hates everything. Just love yourself and the rest becomes easier.
Fuck you, that's how
Can‚Äôt wait to listen! Look forward to each episode.
Being disgusted at disgusting things is grown up.
Love live [NAME]
43% on a one bedroom apartment (with a nice large balcony) in Potts Point. Sucks to be single.
A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional
Didn‚Äôt mean to offend, sorry if I did. I‚Äôm a firm believer in less glass( phones) and more flesh/blood. 
It'll still be beautiful! They'll just have to be prepared to get a bit damp!
Yeah, I started to see that as a better option from reading these comments since I own most of the house anyway. Thanks for your advice.
Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself
they're shite - disgruntled OCSC fan
I've been seeing these since I was a kid! Wish we all had an answer...
It‚Äôs ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess
"I really love how he just flung out ""dead mum"" on the offhand chance your mum was actually dead. High risk, high reward."
I dream of a world where that won't even be an option.
"That's encouraging. I have similar amounts of ETH and some LTC that's ""pending"" withdrawal from monday. Hoping I get it soon."
The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase 
League wants an LA team to finally work so bad
It was the only thing that changed. The weight gain, terrible acne, and moods... it was all nasty.
Went on a trip to the Austin area. This park is nice if you haven‚Äôt been there. Subscribe if you can. Enjoy
Dude awesome job being the reading police, great work out there tonight. Keeping the streets safe.
"It can get ridiculous ,too. She'll actually yell out ""stop yelling!!!"" when she's the only one yelling."
Eyebrow zits are the worst. I'd rather have a lip pimple than an eyebrow pimple. Also part of the fanclub for your eyes.
That‚Äôs crazy! Really bizarre. Is she off reddit too? I did notice fewer posts.
Well that's good. Now, where am I?
The only flight delay I‚Äôve had at slc is because there was too much rain at lax
Ah yes, taxes=Nazism. You [NAME] sure are a funny bunch.
forget new buildings, i work at the chase plaza building and am a little bummed that seagram tower made it but this didnt.
Stop it don‚Äôt tell the outsiders.
Love seeing the guys have fun.
Awesome thank you! I‚Äôm sure it was fine to wear but new guy here not trying to stretch any rules quite yet
Plus she's probably going through some extreme grief, life insurance is a huge practical concern for her right now. 
I feel attacked
That dude popped a viagra and got stuck in his neck.
I never used an escalator until I was about 16 and I still remember moving stairs scaring the hell out of me
I am truly sorry, I did not realise you thought immigration had no bearing on brexit. I shall not overestimate your intellectual abilities in future, i promise.
DonutLicious in Spring is the most gourmet one I‚Äôve ever been to.
So 7 years of playing the game (started playing at 15 and is 24 now). Ridiculous.
I‚Äôd love some actual lore relating to OW as a whole not just slapping names on single characters once every 6 months
Wait for real? That's how they met? lol that's both terrifying and completely fitting considering how nuts they both are
Wow you could like hand out anarchist flyers while selling these balloons. Would probably attract a lot of people
I missed this villain of the week feel of the show. Feels reminiscent of S1 and S2.
"I dunno, ""Lobbyist"" and ""Senator"" seem like mighty fine jobs"
thank you so much we do in fact [NAME]
That's a cute little theory
Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That‚Äôs fucked up
The guest judges these last two episodes are so gorgeousss like really
Soon: Mass death of pink-skinned Aussies.
Just make a better game looool 4Head You shouldn't worry about valve stop working on artifact, at least for a year
I haven't messed around with it that much, everytime I go in it seems like people are looking for players way better than me.
Good to know, thanks for response 
Let's be fair to them and say not forever. But at least until I die.
I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
I know, sorry! I didn't want to translate some parts but I thought I had to
Yep...and they regret it. I hope you stay together!
Love it when the wife goes lets it go retro. Also love it when she gets that puppy waxed.
Are you located in Wellington? Just interested to see where garage project is available in New Zealand, because i've heard its limited... 
Love the way his body just folds after the final smack on his head *oof*
Dont worry, as you get older that will stop working or possibly even cause anxiety. 
The idea of that sucks!
But doing those things makes me feel so.... icky.
READ A BOOK YOU FUCKING CROOK.
[NAME] missed it solely because they've moved from the Rookies vs Sophomores format.
Because this is a poorly run franchise. This is a bad team.
YUP. I‚Äôve been healthier since the new year FINALLY smh
Sorry then?
Unique in a subreddit dedicated to finding concurring views? xD Oof
Now you're thinking, 'I hope that's shepherd's pie in my knickers!
I am a 22 year old male... i hope to give mine away to a amazing girl someday...
Damnit, you beat me to it.
This may be the first thing I've seen on here that actually made me laugh instead of just an amused nasal exhalation.
Damn some of these are so cringy that i almost downvote them, but realize that they are suppose to be terrible.
1:30-4:30 it‚Äôs completely dead. You sometimes get late lunch orders at 1 or early dinners but that‚Äôs it.
I always tried to go first if possible tbh. You're not gonna get away, might as get it over with quickly.
That‚Äôs very unfortunate for the bosses. Capitalism sure does commit genocide. Ireland. India. Indonesia. Vietnam. Iraq. Should I name more?
Funny how you're implying he'd even have a chance against [NAME]
I bid my condolences to any player who did not experience release day action. ‚Äú*Glorious battles, tooth and nail* *Noobs arrived, our matches grew stale*‚Äù
You know you could replace republican with democratic and it would still be funny
Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life
Stay strong.
This makes me smile.
In my favourite clubs pretty much always. The people there are lovely. In any other club very rarely.
Thanks for the explanation. This letter sounds kind of cool.
I saw the first 10 seconds and I feel like I understand
aha, guilty
Good luck my tw broskies :(
My experience has been the opposite. Younger guys are sweeter and try harder- without trying to wife me down. We just have fun together
Also the reason for last year, playing him as a cb was necessary but proven to be a terrible position to be in.
Save money and find a good partner so you can be financially stable with someone you love and do whatever you want the rest of your life.
Insulting [NAME] for being captured is good praxis
They‚Äôre looking sharp!!
She might just be insecure. You do have a bit of an age difference, so she might feel like she doesn‚Äôt match up to you.
Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
Please get them into it. Toronto needs a better barn
Its fun to draw in an empty space.
I wanted to bring to others' awareness here to the site and its absurd name. I've removed the link now above.
I feel a lil dumb now, but not as dumb as the idea to switch those subreddits
Same. Ugh
An accurate but depressing assessment of our political system.
Shh don't spoil it for us
Son of Darkness is cool, but also Ashes of the Empire
Hey, at least its not a fucking sauce post! We really need a new season.
You goatta be kidding me!
"My husband and I are expecting a little boy. We will refuse to do the whole ""man up"" thing. No toxic masculinity here hopefully lol"
It's a great side business. Great margins no returns
I will try to pay better attention. Its definatly not just ambient noise. I think you might be on to something with the packages.
She looks like one of my exs always feels weird seeing her about
I‚Äôm legit cracking up at the landlord part
Dammit as a mom of boys that made me straight up tear up
They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.
Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.
I almost downvoted you, because ‚ÄúBoooooooo!‚Äù
nah, my face is the farthest thing possible from cute ;-;
The Netflix version is being produced by the marketing team for the festival. It‚Äôs gonna be great to see the different slants

i swear i've seen this on a poster somewhere at my school, it's awful
It's good
We, battered UT fans, thank you.
Ah, the good old days where you could lose in a game! Yes!
I love how she has no idea what to do. Like stop drop and roll ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
U will hate it shortly
I think I just view her even more as a friend instead of as a psychiatrist. I can‚Äôt help but worry about her wellbeing listening to me
Maybe? But his foot goes waaaay up lol. Maybe I'm just blowing smoke, idk much about good QB form
I didn‚Äôt know you existed, but I‚Äôm thankful you do 
*Fuck extremists.
Wrote some good poems too
Don't tease me with [NAME].
Wow, you‚Äôre so generous with other people‚Äôs money.
That‚Äôs a shame. What‚Äôs worse, evangelicalism or Scientology? Tough call
Ope, got a lil chuckle outta me there, sorry
Most [NAME] don‚Äôt really know the difference. Its an easy boogeyman.
Platinum is the best Pokemon
"Another reason to instantly kill people who constantly use the word ""awesome"" for everything. This is just brainless mediocrity at its best."
I had that, after a relationship of 2.5 years she cheated on me. Oh well, we had fun.
Bitch right!
I feel like that‚Äôs the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
A lack of the romantic partner is the stressful situation in my life.
Yes, sorry reddit told me 2 times a error occured while posting this :/ Looks like it got submitted fine tho :/
This made me chuckle, thank you.
I'm feeling hope for the first time in a long time.
If the ps5 ends up having ps3 backwards compatibility I'll come back to this post to taunt you.
I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K.
Israel is only demonized because they DEFEND themselves from their neighbors who OPENLY admit they are dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the [RELIGION] people.
That‚Äôs what makes this scene so timeless. every one of us simultaneously relates to both the nerd and to homer.

I hate everything about this.
She loves it. Watch Rick and Morty. Do it yourself.
damn those unlimited lorries. Must be in a hurry to get back to Cork.

Someone who seems great while texting might not be that great in person. You can't make someone meet a stranger if they don't want to.
A guy tried to do this in France after the French Revolution. Did not go well.
It's not vague at all. No one aside from slave owners thinks anyone has a rightful claim to another persons life.
Or just head on to Galleon's Grave. I just hate Dagger Tooth.
Totally hamberders the President, thank you
Yeah they taste so fake!!
"""No"" is the complete sentence I will use for this exercise."

******fucking internet, am I right?
Hold on to your butts!
Simply amazing.
I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt hear the excuses for harden post season success after he blew two 17 point leads in G6/7. 
No the bubble is love. The bubble is life. With the bubble comes zero expectations and a sweet sixteen appearance. Such is life in South Canada.
I will kill you all
If somebody is fundamentally unsocialized chances are they behave socially inappropriate in more than one situation
Just try the free trial. I got bored of it in 4 hours, so no buy for me. 
Thanks for the information. What about any programs in the air force.
Gungrabbers? You act like they're busting in your door and taking your guns. No one is forcing you to do this.
Okay, thanks. Dont wanna get banned want my rewards from commendation thing.
Unread. Unworthy of my or anyone else‚Äôs attention. You‚Äôll have to hate alone today, [NAME].
That‚Äôs great, thanks for the reply and info.
I did not downvote Mate :) In fact I just gave you two upvotes :) Cheers :)
Yes. Exactly. Anything non [NAME] belongs in the trash. Glad you agree.
U.S. are going to fuck this [NAME] guy so hard...he's going to need help to remove all the stars from his rectum
Even if you think me and him aren't soulmates, youve gotta be pretty sad to think soulmates don't exist. 
I would love to jam with you guys but I would need to buy an instrument here :(
I‚Äôm so sorry. You deserve so much better.
Also technically wrong, it would be last year but not a year ago.
Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
You just gotta man up, go out there, and get that kiss.
I'm on your side with this one. At least you have some legs to stand on.
Optimism dial at 13, absolute mad man
That's not really true, people judge all the time, it's just that they're usually too busy judging themselves to judge you too. 
Happy cake day
I wish I could upvote this a thousand times
So you don‚Äôt agree with having success, self-worth and self-respect, and a purpose in life?
Seriously. I had 2 jobs and was in college. I sleep more now!
Last time we played this well on January, we had an allstar center üëÄ
It‚Äôs shame that despite the years of dedication, persistence, and hard work. His efforts are reduced because of his height.
I hate [NAME] omg I just do
I just enjoy feasting off tears ....mmmmm
And ALL of you will tune in next week because it‚Äôs the best trash TV ever created!
He will regret nothing I'm sure
I can easily relate to that as well. The siblings are the ones who will stick with us for the whole journey to the very end.
Haha I‚Äôm not expecting anything at considering they‚Äôre 2,000 miles away from me. I‚Äôll be surprised if she does give me numbers,
I'm going to Rome for a second date. The joys of Bumbling while back home for Christmas and meeting another emigrant.
Skyrim kinda aged poorly but I still keep coming back to it. Might start another playthrough soon.

Mountain West/Southwest so far, but it would be awesome if he did a film set in the Idaho/Oregon mountain wilderness.
It‚Äôs definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.
I want to date that guy (platonic date). He‚Äôs big and could give great hugs.
Lol what are the odds, I‚Äôm also 6ft 1in around the 160s but I‚Äôm only 16 years old though
Society started going downhill at exactly the point where I became negatively affected by social change.
True. And he's free to leave if he doesn't get it. Relationship is a dance
MAD JOKE!
Nah, I know why I am depressed, and I'm sorry to say it has nothing to do with you. 
**GOD DAMN YOU, FIGHT BACK!!**
In sorry but that seems like quite a shallow grave...
It's a situationally dependent call. Yes, I would call *it* again if I had another chance.
Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
I agree with everything you said!
I arbitrarily hate poo-lice Get OUT OF MY POO
With the high turnover rate maybe it does lol!
I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(
Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.
You‚Äôre right :(
The mom looks like my great aunt when she was younger.
[NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
Unfortunately 22tcm is not standardized, as long as it's Armscor exclusive it's irrelevant.
I can‚Äôt wait
Hopefully they can bounce back and take out the anger of this loss on the pistons, then start a new win streak
I'm sorry to break the news to you. :(
Not for me. The ankle area is the least painful, compared to the rest of your body 
"I know, right? What an embarrassment that local news would call that thing a ""tractor""."
NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about

Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!
50 becoz I‚Äôve used before and it‚Äôs A really intense high but after a bit of research I‚Äôm extremely hesitant to use it again
Tears of happiness rolls down the eyes
When people who know nothing about MLK besides their middle school education talk about MLK
Likewise, Reddit has just gotten strange recently, sorry for misinterpreting.
worst is when people with dogs think they know what it's like to be a parent omg like you dont even know YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
They didnt watch everton leicester yesterday. Pretty sure everyone was still drunk
Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade.
By that logic its seedy and insincere for google to act like they care about Homealone.
Thanks very much. This is helpful
I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.
Yeah but that post is a day old so OP won't have any chance of getting karma off it, cmmon now
Haha wait why does this sounds so familiar
I'm impressed that you have little knowledge of the game, would you unsubscribe?
That‚Äôs on Canada. Sorry but I gotta give credit where credits due
Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
ahah I hadn't even thought of it until the scenario I mentioned above, so dont feel too bad.
Please don't come back.
Well I hope so, I work in a pawnshop in a not great part of town and I'd love to be able to carry
Yepp. I've struggled to hold a job so I'd be in trouble without it.
These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
glad to hulp
Yeah yeah science, but I never said anything about meeting forcing him. That's disgusts me.
It‚Äôs ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
[NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
Sorry, what?
Please share lol
yeah but FUCK devil roar. I swear a volcano happens every single time I step on land there
What the fuck I thought it was normal to pee before taking a shower and like not pee in the shower Especially if it‚Äôs a shared shower ew
exactly how i feel about it too. the guy is just a jerk, and can't be bothered to care unless it benefits him. selfish little prick
I don‚Äôt know what this means but it feels significant somehow...
Stop all the bullshit. Keep AB. Pick one.
seems odd, when you guys consume much more pizza, I would say overall than us
Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
Fantastic, good for [NAME] white. Poor [NAME].
Spiritual success is also massively dependent on other people. Good luck finding spiritual success outside of a community of other people.
Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
Lies, damn lies and statistics. 
Lmao I have like 12 days played cop farming who even does that anymore oh my [NAME] you‚Äôre pathetic for even bringing up ages
Do you need a safe space? Maybe a cold drink? Being easily offended doesn‚Äôt make you right.
83% want it! Have a great weekend In solidarity, 4now
Shouldn‚Äôt really need to pay for this basic sexual experience man, it‚Äôs not very kinky 
[NAME] wasn't accused of sexual assault
I wouldnt mind seeig a few rushes with that NFL overhead cam.
Anyone can edit those pages, so I wouldn't get too excited by that yet (but I hope it's true).
I mean. Wtf is there to do online. GTAO had a shit economy but at least had things to do
KS looks like a prime target for democrats to prove that they can help rural [NAME], I hope that they do good things here.
I totally have second-hand embarrassment for my parents. It's equally bad when they misspell something in their email address (i.e: posion instead of poison) üôÑ
[NAME] could be so valuable if we didnt rely on him to create
Haha fucking gottem
I‚Äôm excited!
Lol I'm literally an anarchist but okay
Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
HYS is the worst Internet comments section. It makes Youtube comments look like Gardeners Question Time.
Wow. A relevant and amusing Garfield comic.
And the new sword is kinda shitty, and not even a complete sword at that price. Also, the sword is really bad for the environment.
Doing nothing is the most tiring thing there is.
Thought [NAME] had a bad game. For such a strong player he didn't get to keep much of the ball when in possession.
Dont break NC. Bring doggo inside and warn the grandparents. Unless theres a good doggo beach/park nearby then maybe go out instead
I genuinely teared up when I heard it in the game
I feel so bad anytime I see anyone fall on their face... I just want to make sure they are ok.
My problem was that Flashpoint ended in 1 episode, when it could've been an entire arc
*people‚Äôs ..this is awkward
I think dogs should vote!! It's alright. We're your friends now. Cheers, pal!
I love this! Thanks for putting a smile on my face this morning.
For real my wife was like what the hell are you laughing so hard at... I couldnt even explain i just kept laughing.
Do You Realize, by The Flaming Lips. But it's not really ruined because we ended/still are on good terms. It just kinda makes my heart feel heavy.
You're saying [NAME] sucks at drafting...?
My darling, have you bowed down to worship the ancient one yet? We are very worried. 
Whoa, thanks for the in depth answer! 
Shitty cars made of plastic
Naw man Asain men have an easier time. Most of my asain friend are pretty boy. Fuckbois lol
I loved shooting if we were gay and 6969. The peanut butter took a while, but was worth it
DAMN!!!
you're right, it's all very murky
This is his 2nd marriage that he has cheated in. She refuses to see how much of a snake he is.
I do! I buy 5-blade Dorcos. I'll never go back to razors marketed to women.
Thanks. I'm contacting them now.
I feel like I say this a lot but I wish we'd run the mudiay frank back court more, I like their chemistry together
YOU BLEEPING NEED ME! YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SUB GREAT WITHOUT ME!
Finally the UN gets off their ass and does something. So glad she‚Äôs finally safe (for now).
Didn't mean to offend
I have a paper yardstick from IKEA in my purse. It has been very helpful for the craziest of reasons.
So happy to see [NAME] regaining his form... we had to sacrifice [NAME] for it, but i‚Äôm okay with that...
Idk, I just need someone who cares but I always lose everyone and I‚Äôm sick of trying to be good enough.
Totally amazing that some peoples' egos can't even handle being honked at.
[NAME] ‚Äú I‚Äôm afraid if I don‚Äôt have money she‚Äôll leave me‚Äù. Yuh, you‚Äôre exactly right [NAME].
hmmmmm I still love [NAME] and a lot of OR candidates but thank you
Busy night for you lol
Stop attacking me
"Oh, I stand corrected -half a million people is ""almost no one"". Bloody hell mate. "
"My sister and cousin got one. I'll probably say ""not even with a gun to my head"" if I get one."
Oh wow. Yeah I‚Äôm very new, only about 8 hours gameplay
The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
His character was created to be a love interest and it's literally the only thing they know how to use him for.
Nice, Butt Stallion just chilling in the background
I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. 
Nice work as always dish.
I‚Äôm not gonna be writing you a paper check!
It's annoying. You always gotta give the other guy a chance. That's how MMA works
Lucky he didn't jackknife.
if he ended up with that chef, damn that will break my heart for sure.
I know what you mean. I'm actually looking for a [NAME] irl. That's hard to find...
My drunk gf found each sentence of this joke funnier than the last and is now covered in toothpaste
The customer‚Äôs a jerk but you‚Äôre really not very clear here.
ok that's kind of cool....
Yeah but shortly after got disinterested so i broke it to her lol
I agree because the issues run much deeper. In your opinion what would be the best way to deal with it? Regulation?
No but that doesn‚Äôt mean people were less happy in the past.
Don‚Äôt get your hopes up for new armour
Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares.
Guilty of doing this tbph
But the seriousness makes it funnier. YES HELLO 311? SOMEONE IS WRONG ON THE INTERNET.
I really hope you won't have the chance to enjoy them because man, I didn't like them anything :)
Very weird game but will definitely take the W
Lucky bastard the cool change came 5 minutes into the wedding
Personally, I think WebOS was the best until HP beat it to death. I loved my Palm Pre.
He must really hate changing dies.
i mean yeah but people need to understand when someone needs something other than just sexual comments and maybe some actual support
All the best to you truly. I hope you can find balance in yourself which is what we all secretly need
The biggest Nightmare
Thanks! Do you think a skeleton fort shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for a 3 man crew of average players?
I love the 'Keep it simple' style! Hope mod won't sleep at this. :D
Had to have my knee drained after a meniscus injury. It remains the most pain I've ever felt. Hopefully hers wasn't that bad
I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety.
Oh sorry dude, I was just looking for the WiFi password. [NAME], but I hope you stay safe
"THANK YOU! You should be able to set a preference before your cut that says, ""no small talk please""."
[NAME] was pretty dumb in s7
she does look like a hooker though lol
im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
I mean, you're the one rationalizing for what essentially amounts to a presidential dictatorship.
> Yes, I truly believe in soul mates. we'll just have to agree to disagree
Thank you so much!
"""Best prank ever"" :) One of my favorite moments."
I agree with [NAME]. I'd read the mention of intimacy as just bait for rinsing.
Thank you for sharing, I hope your mum can find a partner :)
You can always kneel.
Nope, you weren't in the wrong at all.
ranked is perfect and elo gap doesnt exist (fucking kill me)
That legitimately made me nauseous.
Isn't it awesome. And then they get praised for their problem solving skills and dedication.
I don't need a pogram. The best targ killers are other targs
Rejection always hurts, even just a little. Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn't get the meaning. Be direct, kind, but direct. 
Seriously. [NAME] is a hero. I heard he was a volunteer firefighter during 9/11.
The face in the bottom photo is perfect!
Not really. My group of friends are awesome in every way possible except they are homophobic
good luck my friend
The worst is working with dealerships
THAT IS A $200 PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED, i also loved the way he walked into the room all mad, lol
A few months ago I would have loved that idea. Hard pass now.
oh stop IT
This is genius
I'm just trying to raise awareness at this point because I know it's not my system in particular.
Ah ok well I have completed my bachelors degree so I‚Äôll look into subbing as well.
I hope this guy got found and fired. That's way too dangerous. He could have easily killed someone.
I kill them all and THEN overwrite my only save. I'm bonkers.
Lmao I hope almost seems like it just vanished. If someone who likes xans finds my wallet they‚Äôre in for a good day
Yup. Lol
Suffering from success...
Aldi is awesome. Low prices, efficient processes, and treats its employees like people. Corporations actually done right.
Agreed. But considering their poor cars were carrying 1200+ lbs of weight, that might slow things down lol
Depends on the drug. Weed makes me antisocial and when I'm in public, I feel paranoid and I feel like everyone knows I'm high.
I meant from when I was a kid and teen. Sorry.
[NAME] I hate that I had to upvote this dude to the sub it is in. Every fibre of my being wants to downvote this atrocity
Ahh you must be speaking of M & W Industries! I know it well I'll never forget the smell of pickles.
If [NAME] doesn't drop a [NAME] tribute tonight in his intro I'm going to be hella disappointed.
[NAME] with that birthday gift
I mean she‚Äôs very outspoken, she‚Äôs just typically wrong
That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
Don't think you should be nominated for Breakout and Best of the year but whatever.
WHAT A DISGUSTING START
You're 105 years out of date. Please update your beliefs to the current version of the Constitution.
Ah ok! I figured I was getting it wrong.
Just woke up and bull run already started.. loving the üí© show
Oh he works as a medic in CA. So hes an Aemt in other states!
This is great advice. The minions here will automatically down vote due to username.
Thanks for yelling it
‚ÄúWTF, He helped me? ...I‚Äôll eat him last :)‚Äù
I don't understand our immigration restrictions. It's not like we don't have room up here
I just hope the show brings [NAME] back because she was really great.
But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
Shut up, Mag!
Well I don't think it works the other way around. As someone who is incredibly insecure, I am also definitely not a narcissist.
No, not at all.
It's shameful that he has to preface this post with his bias. Couldn't just leave well enough alone.
Thanks the mental heath team at the hospital were good, I can always check in there, if it‚Äôs too much
Great shot!
"The fact that ""TrueChristian"" and ""TrueChristianity"" are so [RELIGION] is extremely telling. The faith is dishearteningly fractured..."
Same pigs who bombed a mosque full of kids learning Quran. In Shaa'Allah those terrorists will burn in hell
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not a military man
Human trafficking is bad.
Well thats just mean.
No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?
Sob then! Be with the emotions and let them out until they pass. I always feel better afterwards.
I think its justified because that dude freaks me out. The less money the better.
I‚Äôve had the impossible burger. I was actually amazed. Thorough review here looking forward to trying the beyond burger
Agreed 100%, Governor [NAME] will have some say in this, they broke Wisconsin law, plain and simple !
DEAD DUCK INSIDE DO NOT EAT. Well, I‚Äôm not sure what I expected. 
Excellent. [NAME] ([NAME] in particular) made me discover my love for DXM and other even weirder dex sounds.
Good luck my friend!
[NAME] has a nice text on this topic. Of flying cars and the declining rate of profit.
LMFAO us going up 2-0 and losing the game name a more iconic duo I dare you
I‚Äôm proud of you. First few days are among the toughest.
Revolver is pretty beast tho, 2 shot close range
Damn! A 4-pack! That‚Äôs awesome.
ooh thems would be nice
Thanks, dude. It means a lot : ) Hope you have a great week.
"That face screams ""Fucking gods, do I have to do *everything* around here?"""
I got the feeling too. It's possible, or the ground is just rough. 
Okay. Thanks for the information. I'll look into it once I get home.
I want to be a rapper. I also like to write poetry and stuff. So to be successful with those things also I want to design clothing.
Enough already. I'm sorry that the breakup is going to be painful, but you can do much better. 
No one is getting jailed for cannabis that's the biggest fucking joke I've heard all week
> Mother wasn't amused and I was forced to smile and bare it Wow, I would hate taking nude family portraits
Appreciate it.. just for trolls sake Plot Twist : The one trick has no mic XD
Done, sorry about missing that before.
Welcome to The World of... Mobile MMOs. Where power can be yours, for a price.
I'm starting to wonder if these are satire... They're too hilarious to be actual conservative memes.
Did you just say suck a fuck?
It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.
Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
Those are some nice guns
Lol! Great question
‚ÄúWhy are you complaining, every team would‚Äôve signed this guy‚Äù
C'mon baby, C'MON DEEP SHIT
I'd be ok if they didn't have a HoF. But they do so I want the deserving players from the team I root for represented
I almost feel bad for China.... but the culture has a major problem with having 0 morals.

Oh sorry on my phone auto correct. Which does jobs you focus on one person ensuring that they are ok
Clearly, he had a bad Wednesday practice‚Ä¶
So what? The LW doesn't. want. more. children.
Absolutely brutal.
Kinda. And thank you. I'm curious about those files and film and fotos you mentioned.
Haha I remember her! And that documentary was insane. (its on Netflix and is called The Rachel Divide, for anyone who is wondering.)
I was told ignar was going to be awful by this sub.
Being so gullible is the frightening part. durr da durr he downvote me
Thank u goalie [NAME]
What happened to [NAME]? I haven‚Äôt followed closely but I was under the impression he wanted to return but the club wanted to move on
makes no sense, troll harder
Everyone else's obsession sounds useful... I get obsessed with certain actors.
We are usually way worse in the 3rd tbf
Not to mention she didn't get her rightful Snatch Game win
Haha sorry, I make hip hop music üòÇ
Top ten nicest things anyone has ever said to me!
This is why im happy [NAME] is our owner. I don‚Äôt see him being a cheapskate
Hoooo boy am I ready for a masterpiece
oppressed by nature!
Its not about not making the All Star game, that's for sure
That sounds great!
Yay the same out of touch old people cycling thru the same positions. I can't wait to see the changes they bring/s.
"I'm missing the ""funny"" part. This is just someone killing himself."
Lmao imagine thinking rubbing a smelly oil on your face will make you grieve better
That is profoundly messed up.
Thank you. English is not my first langage.
What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
[NAME] isn‚Äôt even a homer at this point. He‚Äôs just dumb.
Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.
Tribe member? They aren't native so that's annoying. To me, because I am. 
Nope, in reality this does never happen indeed. Cant we see what the problem is here?
Sorry to hear it man. Grief is the appropriate thing to feel. I hope she is happy in the afterlife. Peace be with you both.
If he wants to play more, he should play better. Otherwise, leave. [NAME] has been very bad.
Too late with having it back. I really did'nt have much back then. So I had a really hard time too.
Nah, it's still funny. I think it would be less funny if it was my country tho 
Good luck, I hope you find it really easy! I did, and I‚Äôve never looked back :)
special for you my dude :)
Nize it lol. Everyone on this subreddit sounds like they‚Äôre 50+
Maybe Orlando for Bolts vs Cats? Or Daytona might be better
I think it's even sadder to go through someone's Reddit account looking for stuff like this to post.
Cheers, I will do 
I wasn't meaning it as an insult or anything, sorry if it came off that way. 
Kinda reminds me of my Uncle, [NAME].
If you want a one minute story told in half an hour then ask [NAME] to tell it.
Aww so sweet. One of mind fights to lay under mine while it‚Äôs in my lap. She loves the heat from it üòÇ
I have no idea what's going on, but I hate when people surround the car like that. 
What he said is entirely untrue fyi
That sucks I'm sorry. Ive always been dismayed at how flippant people are.
I have one crazy as hell three year old boy.
>How do you know I didn't Because you posted this dumbass post. And only someone who didn't would say that
None of these people ever seem to have run their own business.
>lol that's [NAME]
[NAME] damn that apron bump looked like it sucked
[NAME] getting off beat the dribble is hurting me a little inside /: Edit:words
Bro we got destroyed last time, we‚Äôre due for a heartbreaking missed field goal or extremely ill-timed turnover 
this video made me feel like screaming
> It's upsetting. What can be done? We'll have to take it to the high courts, let them decide!
Whew. I thought no one else would recognize Mac Tonight.
I'm very glad too. She has been with me for twenty years now, so basically all my life.
This seems like an excessive amount of work that I don't think (maybe I just don't know any better?) adds any value.
Buff *Nurse*??? Lol, this has to be some god-tier shitpost or something
of course everyones for sure ML isles lose in the S/O lol
Yeah I had a lot of respect for him in that moment.
Only the fools would call Saigon the Pear of the Orient, haha. Stop sleeping on the past too much. And stop betraying your country
Fuck Liberty Counsel. They are a hate group.
Dayyuuummm!!! If you ever get another one, you know what to do. (Record it)
[NAME] damn it [NAME].
Every one hates him so your just bragging you hate him too to be cool . Its not a confession unless u say something u regret
[NAME] couldn‚Äôt get them to the playoffs. Pulling out [NAME] for him is dumb
Small group of friends either outside or at home listening to good music would be ideal for me. Maybe even one sober person to drive our high asses around
Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.
Sure, doesn't change it being overwrought nonsense though. 
You have devoted yourself to this guy and he thinks you would be a bad mom. Fuuuuuuuck this guy. You deserve better.
And how often do you hear about feminists fighting for these women‚Äôs rights? Never. Feminists are cowards.
Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.
The person next to you has a high chance of having candy or something cool packed in there so it would be nice to have variety
Shut yer mouth libtard and get yer MAGA on! /s
Oh. That is unfortunate
I once looked at the I-95 and was hospitalised for weeks.
No noodlebox for you then. Sorry.
That's fucking awesome! I had no idea they would straight up off a dude for trifling! Lmao Winning information forsure, cheers man.
Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
Nobody said they don't have the right. It's still embarrassing.
Thank you. Well said.
Love it or hate it. That kid is a hero
If you can spend more time insulting me than insulting my ideas, then someone else here is dumb.
Oooooffff. That's real awkward, but I mean that somehow still ended better than I expected so.. Kudos ig??
Fight me coward! I will never ne frego!
A supposedly professional article banging on about gammons and insulting people's appearance. Not an impressive display of journalism, just a pathetic blog designed to preach to the choir.
LONDON I honestly don't even understand this one
That's perfectly fine. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Have a nice day.
"!remindme 4 days ""Stupid Entitled Parent, sunglasses"""
Thankyou!!!!!
Sorry but imma hit you with a fat (X)
UPDATE i got a set of spare keys finally and rescued my dogs. theyre happy happy and being spoiled with treats. I APPRECIATE YOU ALL
That's great!
My kids (and yes, I as well) love [NAME] metal version.
Great for domestic workers.
Yeah I don‚Äôt think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
Okay, this helps clarifies things more for me. Thank you!
[NAME] looking good for a big game
What The actual fuck
I would love to hear [NAME] and [NAME] in Podcast
Fake The monkey was a paid actor!
Yes I do. Two bartenders can easily bring home $4k a month each.
I'm cringing for you. Good luck in your future after this.
Which is weird because I can still get hours every week the day before if I wanted to.
Pointless but fun
Umm that‚Äôs me. Thanks I am youngish in these hollowed halls. Mid 40‚Äôs
yeah same issue with hockey short of places like [NAME]. 82 game schedule.
I know and that made me sad!
The Japanese and the British can do it well, but they probably get like 10x the funding per capita.
"> ""NOPE!"" Had a good laugh out of that"
No sir, can‚Äôt hold them over a bowl for shit. Plus they make blunts taste weird.
Please, just open your heart with us and tell us your thoughts.
Those things still haunt my dreams to this day.
Oh, their theme gives me anxiety.
I hate these cakes so much.
Stop saying that ? Makes my tummy upset ü§¢ü§Æ
Yes. Half the posts on this sub are about posing. I think the pose she is pulling is ridiculous too...
Yeah I live in Philadelphia. I also get told I look 14 constantly so I haven‚Äôt bothered trying to even get in hah
I made the mistake of choosing [NAME] once. I'm literaly unable to change characters in Tekken for the rest of my life.
Oh yeah. I love stepping out of the tub and putting my wet foot on COLD TILE. More like thanks I love this
I love people watching from the balcony here
I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôm still finding high schoolers who look older then me at times still. I feel your pain
His left hand is mightily fucked.
Oh thanks a lot! :) Please let me know.
Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins 
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.
I don't think he was going to catch that bus if he didn't hit the pole.
Ohhhh Thank you! I just found them!
She clearly was too afraid to speak up.
It literally just happened. I'll talk to them when I get a chance but my heart dropped for sure.
Disgusting amount of oil.
Not gonna bother reading that you're not gonna change my mind lol
Thanks, I love it 
Well that has cleared up, but the damage is done and there is zero trust now, so it'll never end.
she'd probably do this
I feel bad for these guys. I'd like to be able to help ex-mos in trouble.
take my arrow. so fucking true
I always thought the name of that sub, like this one, was intentionally ironic.
Yeeeeaaaaahhhhh, im gonna need a source on that 40% statistic
I used to have no problems finding them, but I‚Äôm struggling really hard now
Your wife just proved to your son that her love for him is not unconditional. She sounds ignorant, hateful, and should get therapy or get out.
> This is wrong on so many levels.
The commies will be much less sympathetic if they get the chance.
What makes it a non sequitur? The point is, just because someone is in the DSA doesn't mean they are a *democratic* socialist
Me too. Damn that damsel in distress syndrome
The point is no 13yr old is perfect and shit happens that doesn't mean they were scumbags that deserved to die for making the wrong choice.
It's right up there with sites trying sell you gold for the coming apocalypse
Imagine making a homophobic joke when your name is /u/Lebronlover23 OOF.
"Yeah I meant to say the purpose ofnbeing an independent is ""so one can remain annoyingly aloof about primaries and then vote any way in the general"""
That was awesome. Momentum is really something isn't it?
In the time I've been seeing this he has already lost 3
I can't see anything wrong with this message
Just rephrased it into two sentences for you. It's a great story!
Dont keep your mouth shut.
Sorry it was late at night. I fixed it.
I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
dude different folks different strokes. don‚Äôt kill my buzz bro. happy new years!!!
Right... so true. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this too.
Yep... I'd vote to oust these mavericks as well!
Sorry what, seriously? Who decided that shit, that wasn't even [NAME]?
I dont think [NAME] or [NAME] said a word during this exchange. Like umm, yeah we actually love our wives and want to be with them. 
Does anyone have the video of [NAME] drawing the charge I didn't get to see it.
and [NAME] got blessed with a LocationBot cat fact?! There is no justice in the world...
That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
Please go to urgent care and get some antibiotics if you have not already. UTIs can become serious if they go untreated.
Like the poor redhead in True Blood that got vampired as a virgin, but worse.
not since that 9-2 pounding we put on Minn i dont think so
You're right. I forgot more Democratic seats were up for reelection! Thanks!
okay for real, i saw this when the game ended. i died. i fucking died laughing. -sent from my HeavenPhone (TM)
I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
I will read these articles. Thanks for sharing.
I couldn't muster up the energy to read through it all. They're on a different level, and it's not a compliment.
The fact you can remember the games he blew shows how great he was and how few and far between they were.
I am so sorry to hear about your wife‚Äôs tragic injury.
It's not a fair question.
Lol didn't some character mention even the league of assassins was afraid of [NAME]?
Sounds pretty optimistic... I'll believe it when I see it!
Aaaand this is why I couldn‚Äôt do online dating when I was single.
I love the fact that he is a complicated character makes it challenging
`Omnialternative` Thanks, I hate it.
Good to know! I should keep a lookout then.
I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt take bad news lightly. I‚Äôm sorry bud :/
I didn‚Äôt actually know that. I wish I was surprised.
Fuck no i wanna kill the living shit out of [NAME]
You will also be removed from a jury if you utter anything about it.
What the fuck are you talking about
Fact: violins don't make music. And if you think they do, you're stupid. 
I bet you that‚Äôs what will happen, which pisses me off.
Rip hot chocolate 2019-2019
I love how the girl on her phone in the background sees what happened but just doesn‚Äôt care...must happen all the time.
Love Mac n Gold
Yeah maybe shutting down all those barracks near the border wasn't a great idea.
It's ok, it was cancelled anyway
Loved this video so much! [NAME] is my favorite and her pups crack me up!
He‚Äôs 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*
The supplement industry is another scam. Multi billion dollar industry. Stop wasting your money on GNC prework out drinks and go straight to the real source.
We‚Äôve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn‚Äôt rise to the level we warned him about.
Holy fuck this thread is not worth it
I think you didn't read the whole post. Go to the eye doctor.
You [NAME] did not make us look good at all.
[NAME] it'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
70 year old me doesn't give a fuck just piss or get off the pot!
This kills the country.
Look into BRI countries, pretty strong overlap with them would be my guess. 
Cloning shouldnt recreate sensitivity to the Force.
Have to love Billy's commitment. Absolutely hilarious.
May [NAME] bless your efforts. I wish I could be there. De verdad soy Paname≈ào.
It can be entertaining and funny
I'm actually scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. I won't check.
Praying for you. Willing to chat if you need it.
The SJW community. I hate it too cause they are the ancestors of the Civil Rights Movement who where absolutely awesome
Hahahahahahaha give me a piece of that kit Kat bar
Reading on that sub makes me sick.
Ouch, that hurts, would've won without the injury
Quitting porn only helped with my performance in bed, other than that I‚Äôm still anxious as hell in social spots 
I didn't see it either! I feel like the kid at the birthday party that didn't get a piece of cake...
Can't say that I do, no.
My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.
I actually really like it the way it is now! The pink sky with only a few clouds is different and very cool.
It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.
I asked at the Bodies Reveled show if they used prisoner bodies.. I got an awkward no.
This isn‚Äôt unpopular. Like 1 in 15 people actually think this... go say this shit in another sub
after months on months of making gameoverse, he‚Äôs had no time. it‚Äôs getting the best of him now... pray for him
I AM A LIBTAD LOL
Sorry, you misspelled disrespectful. You don't have my trust. Here are the divorce papers.
Quit being racist. They're just being racists.
The third picture is creepy.
Did you just assume my networth? Fucking pleb, I'll have you in the salt mines shining boots.
Thanks friend. I will change everything around here I promise.
More like the choir isn't here, it's on Instagram
No no no. They only have no worth if they don‚Äôt support [RELIGION].
Thanks for the reply. And I'm not gonna do that, no worries. I just enjoy getting knowledge about everything on the earth.
Pretty good, yourself? Edited - Saw the link, hahaha... How you doin? ;)
Thanks for the feedback! I will certainly keep that length range in mind.
His name is [NAME]. He's kinda funny, you should check out his other work.
No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
Google image him. Hes NEVER had a good haircut.
Annoyed by the people refusing**
I wish you with all my heart to find a woman that will love you so much that will get you a bj bell.
Wow. You have literally no idea how American politics works. It's almost as if you're either a bot or a troll.
When my [NAME] is crying...
I'm with you - I feel no connection....
thanks man, i'll do one for him surely, im planning to make one for every player in our squad :)
Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
I like this person.
Sorry. Bad day.
The jackets that we have so many people wore so they‚Äôre musty as hell
Makes me very happy indeed.
I feel bad for him and [NAME] i hate seeing the OGs fall #UNITEGAMING
Wow it looks like we held our own negotiating here, nice to see.
Might be an overestimate at this point.
Im so glad that you have peace today :)
She haven't tried contacting me in 2 years, i guess she lied. Congrats to me, I won the 'miss you more' game. ):
Its not fake. Its real. You now look hilarious for making ridiculous accusations and praises about a person that doesn't exist. Lmao.
We all lose it too fast from time to time...but you have to make up for it. Hope it gets better.
Mate imagine reacting so poorly to be called out to calling anyone who has been discussing ozil and sven unreasonable.
As far as I know, it's still bugged, so just reroll it
I feel the same at 5 feet 9. Feels bad
This is just too cute.
Oh recently I‚Äôve started working out and concentrating on myself. Has helped improved my mental strength as well as physical. I feel ready for anything.
How dare you
And here we see the incel in his natural habitat: an imaginary dream world catered to his vision.
I'd love to see a repo/recovery subreddit.
its great that she takes care of you, but remember to let her know that she can lean on you
It's not hypocritical to find annoying behaviour annoying. The two situations aren't mutually exclusive.
Sauerkraut is amazing, but only as a side to a main.
Fair enough. You know him better than any of us do.
That is so sad, just goes to show we have a lot more to learn about the other beings we share this rock with : /
Get your nose hair waxed. Trust me on this.
It's awesome. Sorry, I am a red-blooded male. I see a beautiful woman with a thick 10/10 body and I like it. üòé
Never go to the post office. that place is hell. pay commercial plus online and order every material you need.
i love folksy cities skylines man
I‚Äôm sure [NAME] was thinking this when he told his daughter that she stunk like a toilet on his deathbed.
I hope she makes enough for therapy for her kid.
Did I just get called [NAME]? Achievement Unlocked!
My goal for the year is to delve deeper into GTO related play and how to better understand how to use that to play better myself and against others
I find both [NAME] and [NAME] annoying each in different style.
"Hey, I bought a few issues of ""Lady Death"" and it was awesome! I wasn't hanging posters though."
Thanks, never heard that one.
Well now I have [NAME] in my head for the morning! Love a bit of Northern soul.
"I'm floored by their solution for ""landing"" the drones. It's so brilliant. I love this channel!"
Can you freak bitchhhhh
HUGE RED FLAG. Don't ignore it!
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
A Wall is NOT a Volition of the NAP you idiot.
We love you, this sub is always there for you, remember that behind every meme and comment, there is someone who supports you
I guess I‚Äôll stay friends with her. Heck I‚Äôm a guy I can take a hit if she wouldn‚Äôt date
That would be hilariously vicariously through the subterranean passages to the bottom of this post.
Fucking refs suck my balls.
New Title Idea : Man gets assaulted for voicing his (albeit awful and disgusting) opinion.
I just enjoy using intelligent words...? I left him
but this girl said no make out lmao she just want a cuddle buddy till marriage XD
Man, my USDA loan took months to process even when the govt wasn‚Äôt shut down. 
Me. I really needed to see this. ‚òπÔ∏è
That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?
How did this get upvoted? This is patently false.
Kind of upsets me that people are so willing to just throw out some wild, baseless accusation like this for karma. 
I am sure the men here who have Career [NAME] and Supermodel [NAME] fighting over him will appreciate this sage advice.
Same. All other map on OG with SSD were fine. [NAME] drops and it's terrible.
This is objectively wrong, what the actual fuck lol.
> IMO the actual root of people's annoyance is that she's an outspoken progressive Not entirely.
Don‚Äôt do this. Unless you‚Äôre a total prick. Communicate like an adult, don‚Äôt play games like a child.
I can't wait till they invent that pill either, and for you to start taking it, for the sake of the rest of us. Fuck.
And this is why I park my car in the woods when I wanna just chill. Thank you south jersey pines
Not saying it's bad. It just initially looked like the kinda thing you use in resection to stuff
That's good to know, then. You can eliminate that possibility from your mind. But gosh. I'm so sorry you went through all that... 
this is painful
The sick stomach feeling should pass in an hour or two, good luck friend!
That was painful to read.
I FFed it too and reading that comment, I am sooooooooo glad I did!
your cat has the cutest face!
That logo looks cool in the morning lol almost cyperpunk
Don't worry about it.
Lol my ex loved [NAME] binged trough all seasons.
we roll tonight to the guitar bite. and for those about to rock, I salute you 
I've got no place else to go...
Full time tennis fans are pompous and annoying.
You seem horrible
Why the hell do we sit trae in crunch time we probably won't win. Give him the XP. Very frustrating.
I strongly agree
:o thats pretty good. Not what envision my boy [NAME] but I like this alot.
That‚Äôs it guys, we‚Äôre racist now
She sounds hideous.
My wife enjoys marking me. We just make sure they are below the collar line.
My home equity rose 120k in the 3 years since i bought it. Just saying
I just discovered her today and I love her music
My husband gets very prudish anytime kids are anywhere. EVEN in our locked bedroom.
Hahaha. One of those rare moments when a reddit title makes me laugh out loud.
It‚Äôs common in business but it‚Äôs nice to see an organization have respect like that (unlike the Stars owner).
Ambien you are my new favortist person ever!
Guys. I think OP blew burns in college and wants to feel better about it.
Thank you for those words. Your message made me feel better!
You must have depression and anxiety.
HAHAHAHA I'M AN ASSHOLE
You‚Äôre ignorance would be excusable if you weren‚Äôt so douchey about it.
Where in that sentence did I mention US backed CIA coups? You're fucking shameless.
Loved it. Can't wait to see more.
5‚Äô8ish my guess. The one thing that blew me away I went to a COD event was how short majority of pro‚Äôs are
Hockey players are more brave than the US Marines. Have you seen how tough they are they are so tough
You are an absolute gem
Same philosophy makes women stay with men who beat them daily
Thanks I‚Äôm falling in love, and it‚Äôs also cost efficient!
Thank you!
She hasn't even fully moved out yet and I feel the same way. I'm sorry. I know how awful it feels.
Nope, although I have some Serbian-American friends there who danced for the Tamburitzans :)
Tbh as a [NAME] this sort of news make me happy.
it's funny how conservatives always say that leftists get angry over everything when conservatives get angry over a starbucks cup or a brown man existing
He‚Äôs a very annoying person and illogical can‚Äôt work with someone like this
I tried that. It doesn't work out very well. You become a machine.
oh, that's nice. welcome everyone!
The left side attack of [NAME] [NAME] was woeful
No, I prefer having a forest
He has never had success
> so much misinformation > No hazing or violence tolerated whatsoever Lmao wut
I Wish the answer were that or simple
Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
You‚Äôre very right, I‚Äôm relieved I was free of this man before anything else happened. Thank [NAME]! And thanks for your kind words 
YES BOYS.
The state of Washington is not in charge of the draft.
Instant fucking turn off, ugh. Fuck us for wanting equality across the spectrum
Long straight hair on the face is going to look quite odd I would guess.
"I figured this story would end with her screaming, ""I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE... THIS IS A CAR.. TAKE ME HOME!!!"""
It‚Äôs not significant enough to be a bad move lol. It‚Äôs a push. Spalding is nothing
That was truly disgusting
Heh, unfortunately true. Especially with US medical system which mostly refuses euthanasia of any kind.
Haha that's so true!
She probably knows but is ignoring it. Lol
But...but...I just bought a new gun in Fallout '76.....and America is the centre of the universe!! :'(
That's awful. If I were a celebrity, I would probably do the same.
He is just awful enough to do something like that.
I actually feel bad for your roommate, poor guy.
I don't know what they say about fools and their money, but I'll gladly pay you to find out 
Yeah dude, that's illegal in so many ways.
Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically
Let's hope that they don't miss, huh?
My thoughts exactly, now im laughing at the people responding to the headline
[NAME]! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The [NAME] are taking over!
All my brother, I'm not talented haha I just steal the credit. 
The papers listed at might be of help.
Out of curiosity, what's wrong with the tribal casinos? I've been many in Southern California that were great, are the ones on Washington bad?
Glad we cleared this up
Holy shit, that's great!
Sorry to burst your bubble, but winners write history and since leave won ... */dodges incoming tomato*
Imma let you finish, but Cutthroat Kitchen is one of the best cooking shows of all time.
I really like [NAME]. He has such a great personality and has great chemistry with the team.
That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here.
I got that feeling as well. Hoping he retires a Jet. We are the one org that embraced him. He was coaching sam every step.
When America decides to care that they aren‚Äôt paying one of the military branches. Which will be never.
thats.... not the type of disco that i remember
Great video, not the same as the gilette ad but still full of a lot of information. 
It's just a really good impression. The actual voice is a bit deeper.
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
Not much? Oh honey, it's everything! You two are beautiful! Congratulations!
My [NAME] it's a mad house over there right now. All of the posts are about letting boys be boys.
Thanks for looking out but we will take our chances with this grave danger.
The whole point of being an introvert is *going alone*
This guy's YouTube channel is actually really awesome. He makes all sorts of epoxy art. His name on YouTube is [NAME]
I'm ok with this. Man, that'd be some defensive OF.
Hey man, as a [NAME] living part time in South Africa, I really appreciate you making a beautiful version of our flag :)
This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth.
No it really is there maybe you suck at google
Some disturbing thoughts, but I hope you‚Äôre in a better place now pal. 
There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.
We created these beasts unfortunately. I don't feel right blaming the [NAME] for this one.
Congrats. Having a steady job (and one that I actually enjoy somewhat) is the #1 thing that helped me out with depression/anxiety.
Love your /u/ so much.
It seems like the problem predates the current administration, which makes me think it has more institutional roots.
I'm not surprised to read this within the sub it's in. Bunch of knuckle dragging storm troopers WOULD be angry to see people liberate themselves. XD
Haha ik I SHOULD be. But I still love em both like a red headed step child.
Stay away from her kids, [NAME]!
I know, that is why I said that. 
It's not healthy though. It's processed. Lol, I see what you did there. Pun intended?
You got a problem with Canada gooses taking Canada deuces
I love Arkansas. /s.
> Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.
No worries. Just giving you a hard time!
Thanks! I've got at least 6 certifications from coursera and a few more from udemy. Good luck to you too!
That was horrible defending what the hell
We have youth and depth on our side. I feel good about what we have. If the Cubs have 2 injuries to their rotation they are toast.
What crap An issue with developing on byte ball is that no one knows what the bloody hell byte ball is
That feeling when you hire a really horny electrical engineer to make a comic...
He was forced into this marriage
He already sucks. Let‚Äôs just nerf him some more.
Convoys were the safest way to get cargo ships across oceans, so that would be yes.
Yeah, well your just jealous that you don't have a cunt like me.
If your walls are not connected sprinkle your lawn in between regularly with diatomaceous earth. It will kill them before they can get to you.
As a BMW owner, I don't understand what this meme is even talking about.
Her husband is disgusting. I can‚Äôt even look at the cute baby when his face is in the shot.
Haha haha! Excellent
Im all for putting rapists in jail, and honestly i dont like [NAME] politically but they tried so hard to taint an innocent man in jail and thats sad
Oh so now we‚Äôre not letting plays finish before calling offside cool..
It might be the other way around! They seem to have a lot of awkward conversations while eating dinner.
LMFAOOOOO that‚Äôs when family guy was still funny
Yeah usually there are the c-1 but this go around this is what was handed. I like them
Wow. This I definitely needed, I'm glad I stumbled onto your comment. Helped in a major way, thanks. 
> [NAME] mother allegedly vandalized [NAME] grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. No....
Good. Can't wait for the lulz.
Great! Can't wait :)
"""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
I've edited my comment. Still a shitty game.
[NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME].
That‚Äôs my favorite insult ever
*Pauses clip to make sure that's not me* We're good. What a disappointing [NAME]!
Wah wahooooo!
Gl hf team we can do this! :[NAME]: Whole team leaves
[NAME] bless uncle [NAME]
I'm kind of struggling tonight. Bored, lonely... man 
Man, these fourth quarters, the Nets are on some [NAME] shit. It just seems mental now
It actually gives me comfort, too. Whatever happens, we will all be there together. 
Its amazing how fast evolution can take place.
Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. 
I go everywhere, the XP and money make it worth it. 
Right. It was wasted screen time. But oh no, we couldn‚Äôt have a Snoke flash back that was 30 seconds *at most*.
Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.
Man I hope someone got fired for that blunder.
It's been a while since I watched anything from WWE and new [NAME] looks like the homeless version of old Lince Dorado.
Are you queuing with him and is your account a high level? Because if that is the case I suggest you make a Smurf.
Ego is a hell of a drug
Well boys. I am going to actually be productive I think. [NAME]. You destroyed poor [NAME] spirit.
You're right. I totally forgot about [NAME].
Well, you're shit outta luck then. All you can do is bear them feels.
Of course, life get‚Äôs better. Just keep on keeping on and I hope you do change your mind. 
My aunt lost a ton of weight by eating a huge bowl of lettuce with a very light dressing and tasty veggies.
Also the world is round.
That troll and his Kotaku cronies have no shame. None at all.
I wear pantyliners mostly every day now due to my random spotting, it helps but I feel the odor is seeping through my clothes. Thanks for the suggestion
I‚Äôm definitely leaving him. I have a 0 tolerance for cheating and won‚Äôt be staying for it to happen again
Thank you for sharing, there are many abusive relationships out there and it's not always so easy to leave 
Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. 
So why did [NAME] leave? They were predictable and mostly tolerable. Three wings is absolutely intolerable. I hate him.
He is good! Funny thing is, a lot of the religious dogmatics in his videos remind me of certain IT posters.
Well that‚Äôs sad. It might‚Äôve been funny if it was fake.
I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.
That‚Äôs horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
I always loved fighting [NAME] in Arkham Origins, he was really fun to fight, I‚Äôm still mad they did him dirty in Arkham Knight
Very well said.
Especially weird considering [NAME] went to Fresno State and [NAME] went to Long Beach State.
Please no hate it‚Äôs my first post bro please
Some college professors and their teaching staff may need to die. Oh, wait... saying that is hate speech.
just ban everything!
That‚Äôs scary
I cannot help but get a sense of schadenfreude when a seemingly shitty person ruins their own career right before my eyes. ‚òïÔ∏è
Sports are fucking garbage. Basically just religion but with jerseys and beer in public.
Interesting that's what I usually do... Are you me?
bahaha! Love it! These additions are pretty *sweet*! Glucose Guardian has the best ring to it though! üí≤üí∏
I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
This mode is dead. Sorry :/
Empire was extremely popular at first. I think it gradually got worse after season 2. Those first two seasons were great though.
Apologies, got a little carried away. 
[NAME], too. [NAME] is very guilty of this.
They should fight to have Vans remove the [RELIGION] star from the back of their shoe.
You sir are a true hero.
I'm so delighted that my boyfriend has found this community.
Well ya but it's kinda too late for that unfortunately
Then income is the right criteria for equality initiatives. That's the logical conclusion we should arrive at from my and your statement
That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
Why is this not 5x5? It hurts my eyes...
Well good luck if you yourself help with that, i'm out of here, i can't be bothered fighting with USSR stans.
Damn you actually got that comment tagged. Could've saved yourself the explanation if you found that comment earlier lol.
Haha... nice
When traffic is moving it is definitely not legal nor safer. I hate how dip shits like you spread false information on this [NAME] forsaken subject.
I actually have an odd feeling the game will become even more fun than before.
This is my fianc√© and I hate it
Really glad the US just passed transparent pricing for healthcare providers, but it's just a first step.
he‚Äôs not happy with me
This is very [serious], how dare you guys mock this [serious] science?!
Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
This picture is a prime example that [NAME] are intolerant douchebags who will always demonize wealth, fame, and entertainment.
That's exactly why I think it would be a bad idea to scrap the program wholesale. Though, I still think that stadium is ludicrous. 
You are nervous. Just focus on the other stuff my dude.
I feel ya.
No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I‚Äôm sorry
Me too. For some reason, even the people that I know that love reading don't read Murakami. I love that lil Japanese man. 
It's just a sexy hamburgler cosplay
It‚Äôs all the anger, it ages her terribly 
The games are that expensive, because corporations have figured out that people will pay that price point. Now bugger off.
Haha I can drink to that! Cheers man!
Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore
Hey, [NAME] nerf to basic damage and no damage mitigation in stealth! Thank [NAME]!
Amazing shitpost.
My inevitable famine is when I run out of pop tarts and get sad
That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
I‚Äôm gunna be the bigger man... blessings on your weekend my friend...
I am so glad that your grandfather learned better and was able to share his story of growth. That takes humility in learning a better way.
I'd be happy for them to take a shot at him, I think he's an excellent player and only getting better.
That's so frustrating but I'm glad you're all safe.
I think you‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous
Cheers to you
I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
Dyscalculia. It's not that uncommon, especially in people with ADHD.
Unfortunately not. üòè
I guess I can see that, especially cuz [NAME] has connections with TMZ and they love drama between two people
I imagine it would be helpful for little kids who cant reach the faucet.
Right. Because [NAME] was a circumcized [NAME] who died for our sins.
I love PragerU r/pragerurine
Her playing with fire, and getting burned. Stay strong. 
I appreciate his deadpan humour.
FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
obviously, its just a stupid question
"And for your daily dose of ""Saints LoL Meme"" you are still welcome at r/falcons we wont stop in the forseeable future ^^"
The tone is incredible.
Woooooooahahhohohohohho nice one Bembry to [NAME].
but if it weren't that way then a corrupt police force could convict many innocents. there is no correct answer to this problem.
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.
I wasn‚Äôt a fan of theirs on the show, but I am very happy for them both and wish them the best of luck in life 
Thanks for explaining. I hope you'll fill out the survey!
I believe [NAME] solved this issue back in 2004 with the racial draft
Keeps going tho. Kids got heart
Thanks for posting.
Most underrated subreddit.
You are right.. There something to be said after banging both your mom and gf while they are on the rages.
As an NHL tv subscriber I prefer that home broadcast, but I see your point. GO KNIGHTS GO from Oklahoma!!!
[NAME] damn it I'm so tired of seeing Instagram between fights
Suffice it to say, I understand why you want to build one, although I disagree with both the solution and how you arrived at the conclusion. 
Curb your enthusiasm theme.
Idk if you ask most store managers they will say they started as a cart pusher Probably bullshit but still.....
"There's too much focus on ""our side Vs their side"" and things just seem to be getting worse"
No way!? Ugh this just sounds painful
Ok but what if you hire him into a management position. He makes women feel uncomfortable and a discrimination suit waiting to happen.
They don't seem to care much. Al qaida or ahrar al sham makes little difference anyway.
I'm so jealous. I'm in NYC for a year and the lack of King Cake is giving me actual depression.
One of the best (and occasionally worst) things about being from Westside is that you can always see the skyline from any major east-west street!
Thank you!
It's spelled HIPAA, not HIPPA. It also doesn't do what you think, and at best it's the ADA that discourages employers from asking.
Nervous for [NAME]. He‚Äôs my all time fave. I wish he would stay retired and stay a legend
11 seconds. I'll try harder next time.
I know logically that I haven't gained real weight but overeating both weekend days makes me feel like I have. I drive me crazy sometimes.
Wow Donkey must be smaller than I remember
Damn you, [NAME]. I‚Äôm a woman and yours are bigger than mine. It‚Äôs not fair!
the number 9 recruit from the 2019 class at USC has already entered the transfer portal lol it's only been like 3 weeks man give it a chance
That's pretty good all things considered, if they want to maintain that, they really need to get a patch out ASAP
Ehhh I don‚Äôt know, I still find it kind of cringey with the ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù talk and all that stuff.
Thanks for explaining the point he was making.
You‚Äôre right to defend your property is more valuable than the person who‚Äôs trying to steal it.
Thanks for being a brave troop, comrade. [NAME] annoys the shit out of me too.
But I'm not happy
My bad.
Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that he passed someone in the right lane???? That‚Äôs illegal
To make her feel threatened
You sound like you‚Äôre the one that needs a safe space (and a Depends change)
thanks mate! yes, will buy some protein shakes today.. fucking expensive but better than starving i guess
I would think: Thank [NAME] it's finally happening
You stole this
the original concern was about one particular type of vaccine, not all vaccinations.
Everybody is just temporarily embarassed millionaires
Interesting indeed üòï
[NAME] would benefit if he could help end the broken two party system.
[NAME] playing sloppy
I amlooking to adopt from there! This makes me happy!
Fun fact: There are only 2,208 billionaires in the world
Very sorry for your loss.
The Blackweb screen protectors have saved my phone more times than I can count.
Always funny how one's income has to pay for others expensive lifestyles ;)
I want to see someone get decimated by a [NAME] hit
Lmaooo I‚Äôm sooo gonna use ‚ÄúAs asap as possible.‚Äù
I like it! It kinda feels like new territory, almost more real than old reality shows. It‚Äôs funnier and lighter too
Happy one week anniversary
True to the first, I hope to the second.
Omg I used to do something similar?! Yeah I‚Äôve worn so many hats and then just kicked them to the curb.
thank u, thank u
No dude. This person has two sick kids and is taking you back to their place... yeah, just no. 
This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
I know that's what she said they dont repackage they have to toss them so instead she brought them home
Knife Fight used to be an awesome cooking comp show
It's nice, but there isn't much there :p 
I don't have children yet so I will just have a long conversation with my balls tonight
Shadow of Mordor 3 looks pretty lit
It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
$9?! Yeah you git ripped off, hope you kept the receipt pal r/sarcasm
I sincerely apologize...I‚Äôll delete and please take this upvote
So dumb it's genius.
sorry [NAME]! üòòüòòüòò
Sad face it is
False. Drop bears.
Liberal Grandma best Grandma.
I really hope more queer couples have kids. It needs to become more normalized. I definitely want at least 2, probably through surrogacy.
I cried reading your last posts. I‚Äôm so sorry about what happened. I hope you are able to make a change in their system.
Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
you get an upvote for that username! I wish I was a funhammer
"I misunderstood ""come back strong"" "
I appreciate the honesty
That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. 
Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
It's really very upsetting to have parents who dismiss this condition.
[NAME] could kill someone on purpose and she isnt going to get into trouble EVER
Damn this is dope
The government won't let scientists do studies on it, so we're stuck with anecdata until they stop being assholes.
[NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
He likes an old song and is young DISGUSTING
Getting AB for anything less than a 2nd rounder + something else definitely isn't realistic.
While I agree that the biggest problem is [NAME], [NAME] had to go too.
I think we have the same grinder. Love the bong!
Journalists not writing the headlines remains one of the most frustrating aspects of print media on digital platforms.
I wanted [NAME] so bad, but at least we got a cute character (little ticked about the scythe but, I'll still play her)
I LOVE [NAME]. I truly do. I will be happy to vote for her, but pointing out clear differences is not negative.
Fortunately, those defibs only require being able to read to operate, so that means a good 5% of most corporate drones could run one.
What the hell does metaphysics have to do with this? Also it‚Äôs a meme, get over yourself. 
>If you can‚Äôt recognize bad acting like [NAME] emotional scenes, Oh please. Why are you even on this sub? Lol
Hey, thanks! :)
My boss had this conversation with me just before Christmas. I start my new job in February.
Nononononononononono this is not happening
I'm so sorry. This is no way to be live or be treated. It's so immature and emotionally-abusive. I really hope your circumstances improve
Of all the stupid terms for people out there ‚Äúwomxn‚Äù is by far the stupidest
please don‚Äôt make me have to bring up fire emblem in trader joe‚Äôs again i can never go back
I love lighthouses
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING!
I would just beat up someone I really hate, my brother.
i've never been baby crazy but goddamn if i'm not always craving an adorable puppy in my arms üò≠üò≠
[NAME] found the perfect position to not have to defend [NAME] or [NAME]. Amazing instinct to be honest
Well.... it‚Äôs even more weird to drink the milk of other species..so...
i see, thanks bro
That makes sense. Thanks.!
>Would I pull my gun if that were happening to me? >absolutely
Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
Glad to help!
Ok but it's pretty cute too
Oh yeah. That character could have had potential if they let him develop properly
"""Then you leave me no choice but to call the police and have you charged with petty larceny""."
The sign doesn't have units! Maybe the speed limit is 45 light yrs per second!!!!
In the prequels the son couldn't save the mother. Maybe things will be different this time...
I like [NAME], but this entire sequence was hilarious. Poor guy. 
I want to come back as a tree
Thank you Burger King! Source
As a matter of fact I do plan to go to germany, and I am already at B2 level in german
I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.
You gotta find that fine line where you amass as much paper equity as possible while not sacrificing what‚Äôs really important in life.
Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
I'm scared for her. The Saudi government has proven to be very brazen in its disrespect for international law.
That's a very long winded way to say 'i disagree'
Lmao is this a bot?
Your ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù is a train wreck at social media. Only skill he‚Äôs shown so far
yeah see some of us come from youtube it's a horrible place never go there
Aaahhh u got a spanking. Lol
Sorry man [NAME] doesnt care about hard working [NAME]. Sad
We have seven fucking billion and more people bork every day !!
Thanks, but I am most certainly broken.
"Oh, well when I said ""we"" I didn't mean Reddit, lol. My bad if that was unclear."
Thank you for your service.
1 is the lie. I'm cheating because I remember this convo from last week.
I was hoping - thank you.
Glad that [NAME] continues to be himself even in a mystery fortress. I doubt I'll ever play another game as good.
Pretty
No. Not worth both whatsoever with what we need to fill
Seriously, I‚Äôve never had rendering problems (External SSD) until now... Not even on the PTR
No! My furniture is floating!
OH MY GOD!!!! The poor parents must have gone from gutted to PISSED in a matter of moments.
Not me, blue text posted it on fb airing out the guy but yeah she really handled it well 
Caring too much
[NAME] is for real. This is gonna be his league in a few years imo. Great pick.
[NAME] [NAME] is like the 72hrs from console of course we like him wtf<3
It doesn‚Äôt really change anything, just side with your preference 
I am so excited to vote for him! [NAME]
I love Fish Stick
Keep spreading the word fellas. Wishing you all a great 2019, love you guys and the whole community.
HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY‚ÄΩ AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES‚ÄΩ MARK IT ZERO!
Nice. How is prep going??
Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
Yaaaay!!
Only issue I have is that tiramisu is a beautifully layered cake and all of that is hidden by the container
Yeah, your dopamine receptors are going back to normal.
What a complete and utter cunt.
i like memes, I just don't like following rules for making memes.
No where was I blaming [NAME] for the lose but he didn‚Äôt help. I just dislike his game.
She didn't believe that [NAME] left a Bomb. To [NAME] it could all be a trick to get her to come back.
Hands down one of my favourite VA's and a main reason I go FemShep or play games she's in.
Hey I hope you know you‚Äôre still important and loved even if you may not feel like it at times. You‚Äôll be okay!
good looks guys
I want [NAME] and [NAME] in Top 3 so I‚Äôm feeling the omens girl
Maybe unpopular but I never eat pancakes with syrup. Way too damn sweet.
She does seem fully committed. That‚Äôs just why I‚Äôm a bit confused. I‚Äôm hoping she does deep inside. Thank you.
Now were talking. Acknowledge our short comings and bring in a guy that is essentially a solution to most of them. Love it.
These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
Oh man I was being facetious It annoyed me so much
wtf i love basketball again.
Incorrect. To cure cancer you need to have a citrus and mint essential oils. Lavender is to calm yourself and help you sleep. /s
Ah, as a fanatical supporter of the Alliance I've not done any of the Horde content, thanks for letting me know
I heard Netflix was cutting a bunch of content so I'm going to cancel and drop all the content myself! 4d chess move baby!
Original with sound. I love the moms commentary
>it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.
Fuck you, tincan. *reads username* Wait ignore the tin can part, fuck *specifically you* in general. 
Season 5 is the best IMO.
I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
Holy shit. Amazing response.
Sounds good ya I'll have to listen to those. Thanks
No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.
That unfortunately still doesn‚Äôt stop the thoughts or really address any issue I raised in my post. thanks for your concern though mate. I appreciate it
*aggressively tells friend I love them*
I‚Äôm ashamed to look at how much time I spend on Reddit
I mastered the smelling weed in public. Just ignore them.
[NAME] has broken his brain so bad he‚Äôs turning [NAME] into [NAME]
Glucose guardian!!!! Salmonblue, you are doing amazing sweetie.
It was his time, even though I'm not complaining about how [NAME] should be avoided. thank you very much!
"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
I love [NAME] and totally understand. I hope she and [NAME] are able to have their healthy baby.
Found the selfish and shitty anti-vaxxer in the thread. How many of us have to die before you get your fucking kids vaccinated?
i want my nuggs mom!
You like [NAME] but dislike [NAME]? That is weird considering that they both are on the same low level of intelligence.
What a poor woman who only wanted to tell someone what to do.
RemindMe! 6 years
They were tricked. It‚Äôs not like those politicians were being honest.
There isn't. It's a brigaded thread. Good opportunity to tag accounts, though.
I‚Äôd keep at this line of dialogue but I‚Äôve got to rewind some videocassettes, sorry. Carry on without me.
Doesn't like hearing the truth
I hope you survive this. Losing a friend is a heavy loss
[NAME] on a pretzel. That is just...fucked up. Those comments are absolutely...I can‚Äôt think of anything awful enough to describe them.
excuse me what the *fuck* was that
You are a wize man. This was a brilliant conversation
That‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôm so happy for him!
What are you even talking about? I'm sorry you don't like [NAME], get over it.
This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
Ain't that the truth. It has turned into one old big propaganda/commercial machine.
Only an idiot would visit places like China or NK. Arbitrary abductions and detentions against foreigners have happened for a long time now.
This is ugly af sry
That would...hurt
Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this.
I'd love to hear someone argue in support of our current income inequality..
Careful, they scare away easily, but they will be back and in greater numbers.
Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.
His sentences don‚Äôt contradict. You just have poor comprehension.
Ooooooh I wanna try it now!
I'll check that out. Thank you!!
True, it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs the last girl on earth or something haha
Thats fine as long as the creative director is still there.... Though the talent will be missed
You finna be nauseous as hell man, Dont stress it though just throw up
seemed so anti [NAME] / classless, especially as [NAME] has kept his mouth shut.
That makes sense, I‚Äôm over explaining and I shouldn‚Äôt have to. Thank you! 
I'm sad that I gave that shit article a page view.
Many of them do love LEGAL ones.
This is scary.
DDR is enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, thanks to DDR A. Hopefully this will lead Konami to considering a new home release.
This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
That's the kind of person who'd fuck up making you a plain hamburger. That sack o' shit needs to be sent through a wood chipper.
Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me
Turkey bacon is some worst processed food. Enjoy
well guys it was fun. [NAME] passed up the open three ffs
wow it‚Äôs literally disgusting that you‚Äôre getting downvoted for pointing out that she abuses her kids. this is the society we live in, eugh
That motto is awesome!
I don't think there is any correlation between sugar and hyper behavior.
Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool
That's an excellent point. Who would be a good '[NAME]' for the Oilers?
stay safe man
I never knew that existed. I'm bloody dying right now üòÇ
Yea he‚Äôs a good shooter love playing as him in MyGm
Oh go fuck yourself with your BS generalization.
My imaginary friend is always busy. I never get to do anything with him eigher :(
"Lol ""progressive reformer"". Gotta love how gullible Chicago voters are "
I‚Äôm broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace.
It's nothing on you. I just hate the idea from a justice standpoint. I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.
"""Why everyone hurts me?"""
thanks for the correction.
I am sure that whatever happens in the end, [NAME] will fuck it up.
Burn through ALL THE DATA
You're a big guy.
Thank you alot, I'll link to it in the post
He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. 
Always look to the odd years brother.
Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. 
You're clearly upset tho, you're not doing a good job proving your lack of caring
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
I would make a terrible partner. Fuck, I'm not even a good friend. 
Hahaahahaaha I‚Äôve almost completed the online story but i only have 3 gold bars so far lmao
"[NAME], the ""launch more satellites or threaten to sue [NAME]"" one made me lose it."
That was actually pretty satisfying
I was talking about have a more positive outlook on life if it's meaningless anyways.
FOUR?!?!? that's inhumane and unreasonable. We get 10.
Don't forget about the flooding in Houston. :/
The Dillard House is literally my favorite restaurant on earth. Their ham is the most amazing thing on this planet.
Not look much beautiful.
This is very cool! I'll definetly be using this.
Just spitballing here, but im pretty sure he likes basketball. Really weird, i know.
Love it!
She‚Äôs just not that into you, that‚Äôs what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. 
*I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.*
Champaign‚Äôs a weird town in that aspect..
I'm glad you like doing - you can feel the darkness taking over haha. This honestly sounds like an animated short?
I'm sorry Mom, your child has autism, or this is a lie.
yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt
I'm glad you called it because it really is a beautiful and beautifully honest statement.
That‚Äôs not a fucking card?!
My girlfriend's creepy uncle gets extremely triggered when I point this out, or that a lot of conservatives are gigantic fudds.
Haha this dude‚Äôs from the area I‚Äôm from. He‚Äôs a local treasure
Violating the law has never been a prerequisite for being charged with violating the law.
I‚Äôm not sure even know sits a fucking painter‚Äôs tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
I‚Äôm not crying, you are!!! üò¢
She does have a great ass I‚Äôve always thought so
It‚Äôs best we end this conversation before someone interprets that differently
that dude steals so many tweets. i hate him
That illegitimate-no-good-dastardly-basterisk deserved what he got!
Yup! Was a great shoot, can't wait for the video to debut so people can enjoy all the hard work. 
And you're competing for moral high ground on the internet. Hope you feel accomplished.
the young and the goal-less Thanks TSN, i hate it
That‚Äôs impressive. I haven‚Äôt picked up a book in over a year.
I‚Äôm fine with that. I‚Äôm happy to be banned from subs like that.
You can‚Äôt
I was thinking about the exact same thing before commenting, thanks for the clarification!
..... That would seem like the ultimate way to get rejected and never spoken to again.
"But 80% of the time they go back to ""single"" (or just remove the relationship status), so no worries."
Really? I live down the street from there, thanks!!!
"I instinctively thought that meant ""That's gotta hurt"""
Vans are ugly as hell. You just cant make a Minivan look mean. Also why are they trying?
Damn man that‚Äôs a lot of progress. You willing to put forth another 2 and a half months getting your new character back up there?
AV is a system where if you vote for a loser you can change your mind and 'have another go'. That's the problem.
Congratulations! :)
I liked TB 18, too bad it tanked. 
I love HBK, but he never pulled these crazy spots off.
Cried when [NAME] and [NAME] gave each other a big hug and [NAME] lifted him off the ground.
Whatever that means.
"Who the fuck reads news *papers* anymore? Baby boomers. This kind of crap is totally written by a ""journalist"" in need of a safe place."
You know they just blamed the neighbor who defended themself.
The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented. The same way the federal government does it, with income taxes.
Not a nice thing to call your lady friend.
Something cute and fluffy who gets to nap a lot, lol.
Thanks! We had fun.
we need to deregulate more so we can beat them. america needs to be #1 in something
this is def an ad to buy doritos, but ill be goddamned if its not a pretty cool recipe
This is oddly wholesome. I love it.
i‚Äôm so sorry.....
It would hilarious if racist attacks against [NAME] propel him to the PMO.
[NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
The classic artifact player response to criticism: you just dont understand it loool
This does not sound like a good situation for a child at all imo.
But realistically if you‚Äôre expecting fine dining at any airport you‚Äôre probably kidding yourself. Sustenance without food poisoning is about the best you can hope for.
I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .
Just try really hard to not ghost her and give her some kind of closure. Ghosting will most likely hurt more... Good luck.
Steeler 4 life lol
ok thanks I'll give it a read and try to fact check
Yup. How sad is it to admit I'm jealous of the ravens run game and defense üò£
Happy to hear this! Stay strong and continue fighting! We believe in you <3!
Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated.
Came for the murderino and stayed to say I drive like [NAME] a lot and it‚Äôs bad lol
Apathetic. Not happy, not sad, just don't care
Forgot he had been sent down and was really confused, but happy about this post.
I have no confidence to boost
Really appreciate this post and article. I just subscribed and between this and the sidebar I'm feeling pumped about starting he learning.
Thanks for the recommendation! This goes straight to the top of my audible queue.
You elect [NAME], you get what you vote for, Utah. Congratulations, you got what you voted for. Vote smarter next time.
[NAME] fucking dammit
..and it's awful. What a waste of money.
It's weird. You might be right to worry.
When I drove refers I was always afraid this would happen to me. I always shut my doors I'm just a worrier
FFS, there is a [NAME]?!?!? Seemed really qualified for that county job. So glad to see this family go downhill....
All I'm saying is there is no way I would let one solo drop my whole team with a quad 0% chance
It pains me to see [NAME] used in this abhorrent meme
fucking seriously.
Can someone summarise it here? I can‚Äôt get past the paywall.
Also, if for some stupid reason you want to pull a move like this, you better shoulder check 
*tomorrow Thank you for this.
Thanks, do hv a therapist. He doesn't think I am violnt. I want the thoughts to stop. 
I'm pretty sure [NAME] is the single most reported character in the game.
How to PRETEND to have ice powers? Wikihow, *do you think this is a fucking game?!*
Might as well give Baron [NAME] a shot. He stepped aside for [NAME], he probably deserves a real shot now. 
Just saw your edit. What the crap. Guy was obviously creepy.
I don't think I'd like that either.
Oh I don't think so. I like AOTC and am looking forward to watching a 5 hour analysis of it.
Don't just distance yourself, BLOCK them
And even though it‚Äôs only half carbonated at this point it still gives her those weird wet talking burps.
As The Pot Bro's always say. When the Cops ask you questions. Shut the fuck up.
You could be right!
My comment provided shame. I am nothing.
Pretty convenient my drool hit the upvote!
[NAME] the amount of protection that you are wrong *because* you are an outlier at all.
[NAME] are you me? Like I was relating and then you said rot in Atlanta traffic and the pains of 285 burned into my mind.
I live in Raleigh and all the Canes fans I know love it. So the players love it and the fans love it. Everyone else can chill
This is a weird thing to be concerned about.
No thank you üòâ
Look at downvote_me_moreYOLO's posting history. Looks like a UofT student from the GTA. Judge the source and throttle your anger accordingly.
that most of the fandom does not get that reference is depressing
Thank you. I appreciate your kind offer.
I fell like you're being willfully ignorant of reality.
Policing is inherently coercive. Anyone who opposes coercive authority must by definition oppose policing.
Truly. This is how family stays family. I admire this child so much.
> I just don't see how this movie wouldn't get dull after about a half hour. then cut it at 90 min.
One of my favorite porn sites ever. If you're looking for good incest porn, it's the place to go.
[NAME]. I love that this is the top comment.
I like turtles
You‚Äôre amazing thank you so much!! :)
[NAME] looks great
"I started a play about a man with tourettes and no fingers. Critics called it ""offensive and pointless""."
Not out of a trash can though, surely? That'd be disgusting.
I watched my team get deep dicked in the natty. I understand
I did that a few weeks back, bronze-> silver, etc. took forever lol
Hijacking <---- THIS IS A GOOD THING.....chicks llike guys with balls, and chicks with balls.
I like [NAME].
It's racist.
Thanks dude.
black bears will run off if you yell at it. if its a grizzly, you play dead and hope it believes you. 
Ah ok, will do, and thanks!
You lot are sick ! I tell you sick!! Lol
Im so glad that he Reacted that way i feel the same way about my college but im in the last semester ü§ì
I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. 
hell even clem would be if she witnessed it happen
Every time I see this it makes me so happy.
 Don't be so stupid. Terrorism is inherently political, religion is just one of the tools used to carry it out. 
you're welcome!
Yeah being up by 20 every game does that unfortunately
It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use ‚Äúkicks their trash‚Äù. I guess they just don‚Äôt want to swear.
Hey thanks, I appreciate it!
>Even though [NAME] quit live performing after he got diagnosed but ok
They need to practice intuitive feeling and depression acceptance.
>[NAME] loves people For dinner?
"I might be a prude. ""Suck him off in the bathroom of your friend's home!"" Those don't equate"
Nah, you‚Äôre pretty fucked given the amount of weed you smoke and the fact you‚Äôre planning on finishing your 1.5 grams before the test.
Oh the irony of the sweater she's wearing.
Too many scammers and time wasters anyways!
So we should just complete one study on anything, never question the results or methods, and just accept the initial study as gospel. Gotcha.
Lol I still reference this clip with my gf ha this dude is a legend
I feel you. Most look generic af. I've seen some absolutely stunning ones though. Like [NAME]. She's a 10/10 IMO.
That was such a good cast. Loved that year.
It‚Äôs never funny if you explain the joke smh
BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.
That map looks interesting. I have always wanted an oil platform in game.
Good point. Personhood isn't officially granted until you become property/ a bond of the state.
Welcome to Texas though! Go explore it!
It feels to me like your Dean has some baggage and you shouldn't let it weigh you down.
He's ridiculous, I've never watched out west when he was on the Spurs. But damn. Hope He stay.
Im glad to hear it !!!
I have a lot of unopened DM‚Äôs but thanks
Oops, forgot to translate from UK lingo 
We had a clown banging on dorm windows, on campus, with a knife in 2016. Was terrifying. 
Nope! His real name starts with a G. Weird spelling of a common name, and pretty identifiable so I‚Äôve never wanted to use it üôÉ
I already told you, food poisoning or allergic foods. The real greedy snake oil salesmen are big pharma.
No I‚Äôm happy to spend big on myself. I‚Äôm not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
Thats one way to make political and economic instability sound super fun
Only a dozen times? That‚Äôs nothing. You can do that in one evening. You‚Äôre giving up before you even tried!
That last sentence pains me
That's not the first time I've heard it said that a GA acted assholic, not apostolic in real life. 
regret unfollowing him...
I like them
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.
Ahhhh fond memories
Exercising. Yoga. Meditation. Walks out by myself. ( walking meditation) Good friends. Time with good friends.
[NAME] is pretty dry but he's great for down to the facts videos, I love his voice.
Insensitive tweets don't help, though.
You're so cool.
All the game modes are super fun
Interesting, I‚Äôve never seen a barcode on any of my clothes that I can recall. I don‚Äôt buy clothes often though. 
Replace smug with thug and you'll see how racist you are
You k how it's bad when a furry is roasting you
Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. 
Well then you obviously have no fucking clue what equality means.
No we don't. A small amount is imported into Ontario. The rest of Canada is long or balanced.
But primarily, you think external factors are a bigger factor. It's true, after all. 
WHY THE FUCK IS BAYLESS ISOING
55 here. Of course, I could never catch me one of those wonderful incels.
Shame about him killing [NAME] on camera.
She knew the magic words. Luckily it doesn't seem like anyone else was harmed.
How he dropped that sheep, probably going to hell but i almost choked laughing. 
Thank you for being proud of me!
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
Because you didn't realize MEPS was an acronym? Yeah, definitely taking anything you say to heart. Piss off depper. 
No I thought that movie was really bad. I could relate to requiem for a dream.
That's a good point, I didn't think of that. It's too late now, of course, but I'll remember for the future.
Thank you :)
I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since [NAME] and I would kill for my Lions to get him.
I just read this the other day for the first time since I was a kid. What an influential book.
Do you think he is guilty or innocent, no need to use triple and quadruple negatives here
Just not the right year to tank. POOR planning by the FO.
That's Great to Hear.
The worst part is that if you had done the exchange, you probably still would have gotten in trouble. Gotta love retail.
Well if you already bought them why throw them away? Use them up and don't buy anymore.
I believe this would still be a ticket if someone else sees you.
Nice-full circle! Leaving [NAME] for dust- I love it.
[NAME], it's like nobody learned a single thing from the game.
Not sure why you're being downvoted
i'm just making fun of how when moids say they like personality they dont really mean it
Happy New Year everyone! It‚Äôs 11:42 in CA 2019‚Äôs almost here
We did it guys! We‚Äôre the real heroes!
If it's Fttn, then not much, maybe worse, because it's still using that shitty old rusted copper running through that same old leaky pit
I tried at a joke that relates to the post...
It still cracks me up when people call me [NAME].
"""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
I watch his YouTube stuff. It's gross!
I visibly recoiled from that.
Based on the down votes I can say this is truly an unpopular opinion although it shouldn't be
I am well aware of how immature and inconsiderate men are capable of being, but thanks for the reminder. Baby.
Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence.
**You are breaking the car!**
What a pathetic reply. I know we‚Äôre all supposed to be nice here but c‚Äômon.
I knew there is always an Orochi, even in a [NAME] vs [NAME] duel. Hiding, waiting...
They have THE BEST tortillas too. Made right in front of you. Mmmmmm!
Ok my apologies then!
I am very thankful for that. And thankful I wasn‚Äôt totally brainwashed
My partner and I have 17 years between us! Best and healthiest relationship I have been in :)
Nah, only [NAME] are cool for being bilingual.
I think it was, it was do scary, i honestly never wanna do that stuff again
They didn‚Äôt even respond to my email so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna work
> Crab Rave Ayyy I've never seen this before I kinda wanna go but seems scary.
There's a lot big talk here that will look kinda dumb if we're third/fourth midseason. I hope we aren't being clowned halfway through the season...
What? Shut up?
Thanks so much!!!
Crossposting is a terrific feature on Reddit. I'm happy if someone does it to me because it means more people will read one of my posts.
It would've been pretty funny in May. Not anymore I'd say.
I think that's what I'm going with. Thanks guys! u/krazyM
Poor cat.
I absolutely agree 100%.
No wonder RemindMeBot defaulted to one day :P
Nothing more attractive than someone who's compatible with me and has a great personality.
...and I think you just jinxed it. I hope not ü§ûüèΩ
You stole an Instagram meme? For shame
If nothing was said and you can be engaged all day tomorrow then I wouldn‚Äôt worry.
i can change mood for no reason on seconds. Im happy ish. To sad or frustrated to anger and rage and not always in that order.
After Ohtani, I can't bring myself to believe any of these unverified twitter rumors again.
And in some US states, still that range just sets off weird vibes.
‚ÄúJinkies, unmasking the monster is such a pain... Nyeeeeeeeeh~.‚Äù
[NAME] is pretty fucking scary
My man loves his beer more than anything in the world.
You are not wrong. I have learned about myself alot while on drugs. Sometimes it's scarry when i find out how limited my mind is.
I really wish my husband could get his sleeping disorder under control.
I miss him on our pp
[NAME] is playing with the confidence, aggression, and awareness that I wish [NAME] and [NAME] would develop.
[NAME] rolls with his kitties and is hard as fuck.
That is beyond disgusting.
Fucking hate [NAME]..
I mean if you hidden the initial hit you can punish anything he does after
No you don't, you love lies and liars. 
That is so adorable. Her username as well.
That isn't really true if you've watch all Arsenal games this season.
These edits are retarded. Why do people get so giddy for internet points.
Likely. Just let him take every single shot all night and see what happens.
> Im a milan fan I'm so sorry.
Happy to- good luck!
Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit.
WILL YOU TWO SHUT UP? PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP
Yes. The Brasileiro is a notoriously difficult league, and Corinthians aren't even considered to be a rich club.
I‚Äôm not guessing anything. I didn‚Äôt make any claims about her viability against trump. You did.
No, don‚Äôt wait it out. Do everything you possibly can to lose it earlier in the meantime.
What a douche canoe to take advantage of you like that.
Good layup [NAME] now just try not to get completely lost on defense haha
Thank you. We're as messed up and fallible as any other set of parents, but we're trying to learn from our mistakes.
For me it is unwatchable after the greatness of the LD seasons.
This is an awesome idea. I'm in with my coins when this is ready to roll.
Haha ok I thought it looked like the vine logo, but assumed I was wrong since it‚Äôs been dead a while.
No, princess, your body works the same way as everyone else's... You are not a mystery of physics. 
Great. Literally nothing is sacred anymore.
It's irrelevant because that's not how we elect presidents. He won an electoral landslide. He flipped several democrat strongholds. He did just fine.
Stay strong brother - it's coming.
I‚Äôll keep the fruits of my labor and my firearms thanks for the cute ideas though, sounds nice til it‚Äôs you in the breadline 
I really love all the downvotes on this posts comments cus it goes to show ppl can‚Äôt have their own opinions on things.
Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. 
I did that my first day of middle school (got off at high school instead) but that's probably because I'm an idiot
My condolences.
I had to put Bird Box because it's the only direct to streaming movie I saw. I feel dirty.
This is completely false.
Youre gonna be really disappointed when you hear [NAME] track with the guy from Degrassi
So basically what we have is a horribly exploitative business model meant to prey on drivers by tricking them into accepting unprofitable rides.
Good luck to you all. You don't owe your dad anything, don't let anyone guilt you into seeing him.
I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.
Indiana resident here: fuck this state.
Good luck!!! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
We do? Strong disagree.
I was hoping this day would
thank you for the suggestion. i'm not on fb though and would prefer not to be, as far as that goes.
Haha love it!
thanks <3
What a fantastic combover! What brand of comb do you use?
That‚Äôs part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women
Living his best life.
I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.
You‚Äôre not winning this one. Move along.
[NAME]‚Äô ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his ‚Äúsisters‚Äù to harass people.
Irrelevant what is deserved, as if that's objective. The only thing that matters are the facts and they don't support a move like this.
Third here. Oh, ok. Wow.
Fuck the people that couldn't make rent, pay bills or medical costs because of the shutdown, right?
No, I'm saying they are equally critical.
Ahahaha I‚Äôm enjoying your troll. Seriously remember commenting on it like a year ago. Hilarious people are still trying to correct you.
Stick to your arts degree, the men will keep building this province, regardless of having to fix garbage the TFWs built.
I just open mouth laughed so loud my kids came out of their bedrooms, phone in hand, but still...they came out!
Thanks [NAME]!
I lived for your comment. I'm a goofy goober, yeah. 
Your comment is completely irrelevant and you're trolling me in order for you to cry and whine about Detroit. Get out of here.
Don‚Äôt kink shame me!
That's because he played the end of the game when they were feeding [NAME] with no results.
Moving in general sucks, moving a book store must really suck
Sorry, I have plans that day, week, month. Watching TV while you peruse Reddit are plans aren't they???
I'm so sorry about your friend. What was he like?
I like your honesty
Consoles can‚Äôt hit 120 fps in fortnite m8. You‚Äôd be lucky for like 90
I dunno. I like her.
Why should I care what he thinks?
I read his book. I liked it. Sensible advice, and he's a good writer with an interesting background. 
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm pretty out of it for New Years so I probably knew-jerked more than necessary. Happy New Years my man!
This is so true!! I'm vaping mango right now! Weird... Wish I was a kid.
seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
False equivalence in the sense property rights aren't enforced but more accurately defended.
Wow.....
Did you just call me a *bitch*?? You will NOT disrespect me like this TODAY!
Hot damn it takes some real self-confidence to say you can't do things in MS paint
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** ThaJarseff! ^(hug)
It‚Äôs so sad that i can play all these Zelda games on my 3DS but not my Switch. I have like 12 Zelda games on my 3DS
The US and Canada are great allies, it's really a shame they've elected their worst. 
This subs favorite game.
I hope this becomes regular for you both. üëçüèæüëçüèæ
Ha! I can totally see him having these pictures on his dating profile. He‚Äôs so cheesy lol.
Sakura drops & Goodbye happiness
Does anyone have a link to the rainbow song clip? I tried looking everywhere and can't find it :(
This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
Hopefully no one was sitting on his lap at the time!
Not when it‚Äôs literally contradicted and not corroborated by every other one of that witnesses‚Äôs witnesses.
I will downvote the hell out of any news article promoting ponzi schemes.
Thats even worse than what you put up (no offense really). Your work is well done just a hideous design.
Happy Cake Day! :)
Married to the love of my life. LOL
Sorry was late at night and i was in a real depression fog
This is awesome. nice!
So insightful!
I'd be pissed off if I was a [NAME] who voted to remain in the UK & then got shafted by brexit..
Get well soon good boye
Damn kev I knew you love [NAME] but wow this is next level
Always felt like this match would go 5. Come on [NAME]!
Broke and jealous
thank you so much! :)
Smoking a pipe whilst laying some pipe. Fantastic.
Good to know! We didn't get any when we went Friday evening, but we can try again.
Fucking pouliot you're shit
The number of pedos is too damn high!
That they wield to great effect to tell *you* why you‚Äôre crazy and how it‚Äôs totally not their fault
>...fresh fruit and fish. Sounds like paradise!
You're right, it's not as bad as the crippling retardation you currently suffer from. I'm sorry dude
Not heinous for sure, but frustrating.
yeah [NAME] can eat glass, that guy fuckin sucks
You've aged horribly'
That crowd reaction for dirk at the end. What a legend
Srs I have tears in my eye from laughing... and also because I‚Äôm immunocompromised and live not too far from there lmaoooooooooo
[NAME] damn I love [NAME].
Well, it's been fun. Time to quit YT.
Well attention whores are women(mostly) that always seek validation from other people, something that can really become very obnoxious and annoying.
Fake was the right call either way.
You are not alone. We do not sit in this darkness alone, even though other lack of light may make it seem so. 
I hate to say this but I love the drama around this all.... idk. My life is boring
Damn liberals!
It's gorgeous
Newcastle too. Fake snow news!
Aww that was endearing [NAME].
Kid has a disease/condition where his skin falls off at the slightest touch
Thank you [NAME] goodnight
I enjoy cycling too much lol
Depends on who rates you. They don't all do it. I stayed at 5 till about 40 delivery, then it started moving around alot.
Damn... üòë
I really like hearing the Australian accent of someone speaking Italian.
I thought I was done enjoying the Saints loss but this brought me right back. Great find!
USE GLOVES YOU MANIAC
Thank you sir
I don‚Äôt believe any of that is true all hearsay no proof of any of that .
Females living on Recruit difficulty. Smh
There are other petty crimes that can be more heavily prosecuted, like unpaid child support. 
Safe to say we‚Äôre out of adjectives for him now
Sorry, I just got to give you an extra upvote for 'twat waffle'. It really sums it up marvellously. 
Taking a blood thinner such as aspirin would keep it from clotting
That's true, and I love pitbulls, but a poorly-trained Chihuahua isn't going to rip your face off, nor are they naturally disposed to aggression. 
[NAME] is an **integrity** man. Without it, there is nothing. edit 1:without it, not with it, sorry typo
what a ground licker. Day 9799 of being alive - I still hate people.
The stupid is real
Same! I don‚Äôt know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
A sharp stick? I think you need a rifle to kill that bastard
Happy birthday üéÇ!!
Yep happening to me all the time at my college. Fuck everything
>[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
I found all mutual nut destruction games to be ridiculous and I never played them. My friends all loved them though.
They played loud music on a ‚Äòschool night‚Äô, seriously! You‚Äôre backing the bastards here just to be contrary.
It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again
Thanks for the recommendation! Hopefully my Ulta will have some to swatch!
You can love both [NAME] and the person you are with.
I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.
That's pretty much ALL complaining...
I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord.
Seriously! I'm on Xbox and all my crew and we have never had an issue!
Any league that creates a system that makes a kicker more valuable than WR/RB/QB is a league I don‚Äôt want to play in.
He's back! I missed him. He is the most entertaining thing on this sub.
I was afraid things would if we kept seeing each other, which is why I brought this up to her now rather than later. 
im glad to hear that i won't just be carted off! and thanks, it's great to know that you guys have my back :)
So Green Bay doesn't get him... I'd be sad for the kid.
The cruise boat one (similar) where the water goes WELL over the porthole scares the everloving shit out of me every time
I'm thinking he ment [NAME] but he's still a karma stealing whore.
No one comes here it‚Äôs cool
"This is not surprising at all. She's a fake trendy ""feminist"" with no perspective whatsoever."
we def don‚Äôt deserve dog s
All the things you mentioned are basically aligned perfectly in 99% of cases.
Lol loving these choose your own ending memes [NAME] üíï
Great movie. Great TV show. Simply perfection.
hello im bipolar 2 the fun kind
Well poops. My friend and I want to wander and look for such things but we can't. Boo!
"Not only that, the ""improved controls"" aren't a thing at all. I'm not re-buying Blood Money for nicer graphics. "
Ha. How funny He's the only geezer who thinks he's madness.
This just looks like it‚Äôs actually from porn lol what is the original context
thanks i won't click
I also posted about this a few days ago. Maybe they have different designers but none of them has follow-up or approval from a single person, unfortunate
I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.
The original DayZ mod music was pretty intense.
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
She's not. She's not in any place. She doesn't exist.
shut up, [NAME]!
Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can‚Äôt afford to watch anymore of them.
Aw Thank You.
Thanks, I'll do that next time. I didn't mean to get blood on it after all.
XD lol yes. Ragnarok
I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward
It was a poor choice of words.
I've had all this... except for the last part.
Everyone‚Äôs freaking out about our OC. Our need for O-line is more substantial imo
wow that's dark
I just discovered her channel recently too! She's hilarious and I love watching all the diet tryouts.
Poor lady, she was the mother of a friend of my wife, and she went to school with my father in law :(
Yep, it would be super easy. Honestly makes me regret not doing that to the flames sub... /S kind of
Oh yeah lots of elitists who think they‚Äôre a damn gemologist but know nothing üòÇ
One week sounds like a good timeframe. Good luck on your channel! I hope that expected revenue goes up for you.
I‚Äôm happy he made it and not [NAME]
That‚Äôs so romantic!
Have a good one!
More like 11 feet up, but still painful. 
"This is stupid, if it is ""standard"" within mega budget movies, what is Lucasfilm excuse not to be prepared? "
Unless you're a conservative trying to protect yourself. In that case, good luck.
>It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea.
Thanks! You too!
Well done, OP. Thanks.
It‚Äôs broken garbage. The most broken unbalanced tekken game by so much it will make your eyes bleed and give you a brain tumor.
no it doesn't, hmmmm I sent in an ask on the discord support page about finding people so lemme check that
Nope. I like looking at people.
Oh I was unaware of this! Thank you!
It sucks being unattractive. It pisses me off that there are so many beautiful people in the world, and I ain't one of them.
Feminist narrative... it's always the mans fault even when he's helping someone out, sleeping, and gets murdered.
I love it! Guy in front can steer, can't propel. Guy in back can propel, but can't steer.
He makes Talking Thrones look good.
>lox is optional How dare you put '[NAME]' in your flair! How dare you.. Mods! Mods! Apprehend this impostor!
Anyone else want a TE early? Tired of fucking around with the position even if [NAME] did look pretty mean for a few weeks
I really love that game. It's so chill, I played it a lot. 
They added it back for a short time but removed it shortly after.
whats it like being this stupid?
You just brushed off the entirety of his video and reverted back to the original argument.
We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that‚Äôs not a good argument
Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
Very Cool.
I know how you feel and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. But I‚Äôm glad you are still here
Sorry buddy I think that one is permanently dead. :(
Happy birthday, [NAME]! Hope you have a wonderful day!
it's embarrassing you think that pact is an example of them getting on well together, especially considering the millions of deaths that followed
Hello. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. Why do you think it‚Äôs impossible to leave?
I saw a youtube video once where someone was a ‚Äúfailed abortion‚Äù. They were perfectly normal. I guess the doctor was just an idiot.
I'm so sorry but just do everything you can for you and daughter and of course mom.
That head pat and hug was the physical equivalent of ‚Äúoh my sweet summer child.‚Äù
You should play PoE its a better game in every single aspect, you'll love it.
Wait, what? Lol. Weak call. I'll take it. 
How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir.
I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
Yes but [NAME] advice is better then some randoms lol he was one of the leagues best ever defenders
Boom. Sand. Great image
Not sure about ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but women artists have an intuitive grasp of color theory and tend to use color in a more pleasing way.
I hope for the camera-man's sake that gun is empty
[NAME] game sucks. He's good at comps but his strategic game is awful
Dudes never show any interest in me irl so I was just thinking about getting a Tinder. Seems like people have much lower standards on there so fuck it
The BBQ ranch and Greek are my favorites!!
It's crazy, just something small like that, can make a man forget about all his troubles. I wish I new what that felt like üôÑ
Shut up, [NAME]. 
Fuck you my fortnite k/d is better bitch
I'm not fantasising, I'm watching it happen. Just like I watched [NAME] smooth, supple back.
It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
It's a beautiful thing! Good luck!
Ya it‚Äôs Bamas league to lose every year
Thank you for turning me vegan, good person!
You are a disgrace to the species
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!
All of season 6 is terrible
Huh, and all these years I‚Äôd been *assured* ‚Äúnobody‚Äù was coming to take my guns. Its like they been lying the entire time.
/s. There you go. I have magically inverted the meaning of my comment and removed all inconvenient truth from it
The age of consent is 16. It's the indecent nature of the photo that has gotten him in trouble.
It ruined me, too. D:
Noooo... Went and saved all the webpages as PDFs, though it's not a perfect solution.
Let's us both hope you will be losing it come by the end of the September then... LOL It would be freaking awesome if it happens.
Thank you! That is the goal!
As a contractor this is a huge nono. If it's not on paper it not on your wall either.
That looks absolutely awful. On the good side, whoever made it, can only get better.
Oh boy yeah
That's a cute kitty :3
I heard a fade in/out version of palpatine‚Äôs screech in my head just now. Lol
Now you see me.... Too. Lol
I never read it, but I sure remember being creeped out by this claymation version
I feel a deep sense of shame.
My ex asked me to tell her my steam password..... With more than 6000‚Ç¨ worth of stuff on it. No thanks.
You‚Äôre absolutely right, I‚Äôm 61 and shouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised by the arrogance that ignorance can generate.
Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
This is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve read on reddit this year.
Absolutely, yes. I could not feel better right now, and I could not have felt worse yesterday.
Why do some people use tbh after everything
I have a boobs but a penis, it‚Äôs quite the embarrassment.
Got to love all the fake fans that know nothing about hockey!
I know a dozen local school administrators. What the hell are you talking about?
yeah dude I love my 9(???) with the welded bump stock
I'm so sorry you were bullied in a place you should have felt safe.
Congratulations fellow lobster!!
found it already but thank you
I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
[NAME], I believe you buddy. you might be a weird dude... but no one is weird enough to make up a story that bizarre yet banal.
Also the fishing has been terrible for a month now. I am about to take the 5 story jump my friends.
As a kid, I was way more excited to see the [NAME] truck.
This is probabaly going to be an unpopular opinion but I definitely think all police cars should be clearly marked, unless they're part of an undercover operation.
That's awful. I'm sorry that you had that experience, but yeah, mission accomplished, sorta.
Shameless IG plug:
[NAME] bless your soul. Please keep us updated. HORRAY!
same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
:) i like it
I cackled at [NAME] face down in the corner.
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.
That [NAME] part killed me!
Thanks for reminding me not to have kids
Sadly my boyfriend's family is the direct opposite but we'll still make it work :3
I just got a $250 Bucca order, lets see what happens
Sorry I failed to mention I'm relatively new to the scene . Last 2 years only
The fact that the passenger gives a thumbs up drives me crazy
And he be like - great and you? I'm like Great. And the conversation ends lol :-)
Theyre asking for a leak, not a theory
Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
[NAME] just put a huge hole in my heart.
This is actually a beautiful picture lol
"""Fake neeeeeews !"""
That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.
I‚Äôm as terrified of Mr. [NAME] just as much as any sane person but I don‚Äôt think we should *burn* him...
Noooo I missed the blood moon again. Someone post a pic
That's all I'm asking for :( thank you for expressing that it is a possibility, and for making me realize it should have happened...
Hey, better safe than sorry with spoilers. But my point stands. 
"""Yeeaah, I know you're homeless and all but apartments are actually really boring. My most beautiful memories were all made outside in nature."""
Both [NAME] and [NAME] were broken up, so it wasnt cheating.
Oh shit, yeah that's definitely shady.
Yeah your right thats why I dobt rush things, Ive accepted things take time
That's not even the sub I put. Bad bot.
Where the mask inside, too? Are air purifers not good enough for inside? Sorry for the dumb question... Just moved here this week.
I've had such bad memories, I remember when I remember bad times now! Haha
[NAME] has to lose it a some point, just hope it's not tonight.
I hope we actually dont need to wait like 1 year for this. :(
I‚Äôm excited to see [NAME] come in here. I hope he plays some more quality, aggressive minutes
by the time I found it was a delay it was too late to go back to bed but I didn't have enough time to do anything fun
I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I‚Äôll hate them like the rest. 
I hope you're pregnant, I'm not doing this anymore... Gx
Oh that's hard. I hope you get an amazing nap in the car. The exhaustion is real with babies.
[NAME] love for you
So true, thank you for posting this.
Older nurses seem to have less tolerance for the bullshit of hospital work and move on once it gets to be too ridiculous.
Honestly why even make it about her, I was fascinated by his dedication! 
[NAME] and [NAME] for [NAME] then sign [NAME] afraid this battle station is fully operational
I'm sad we have you at home this year. I want to make a trip to see Allianz.
Yes, [NAME] is truly evil [NAME], his utter failure and stupidity is so beyond reason that when you mention it, it sounds beyond reason.
Happy new year to you too! :>
my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
oh fuck i've never been more sure we're gonna lose
I love the [NAME] conspiracy and this is a good addition! Thanks for sharing.
There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful.
Oh shut up. Quit being dramatic. Another option is... THEY COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.
Um, no, it wouldn't be days before anyone looked for a missing kid. Hours maybe. Not days.
Recover well. (Argh, my english is too terrible üá≤üá´)
The guy that waived a future hall of famer. Hard to get away from that decision.
Tried to ride the Overwatch train and crashed miserably.
It‚Äôs fitting. All things Considered.
I will pray that she (or whoever may be pressuring her into making this decision) will have a change of heart and spare the baby's life.
NO I HAVE NOT EVER FIRED MY GUN IN THE AIR AND GONE AAAAGGHHH!
Incels can't even get a pleb thing called sex. Sex is for [NAME] apparently.
I applaud you (in a non-sarcastic way)
Horrible night for dodo
you did drug her though, and assault her by undressing her and taking her photo. you committed multiple crimes. you need professional help.
I love how people ITT are deploying x/2+7 like it's from [NAME], LOL.
Well, if you are gonna put it that way, I guess I don‚Äôt have much of a choice.
I like it. I hope that answer is okay with you because I might lose sleep if it's not
I Will! Thank you. I have applied for gaelic studies. (Bet not many international students do that but hey, it's a lovely language)
Oh that's disgusting, this man should be sent to priso- ohh, it's America, ok then, feel free. 
I was trying to make the point that the patient is still having a seizure; it's just not visible because they are paralyzed.
I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.
Sorry, but you probably do given the AVers do have a limited literary skills at the best of times.
Yay, now we're only down by 7
No. There's a fair amount of nudity, violence and foul language. 
I love those possum dives!
That guy with the orange jacket looks so distraught. Feels bad man.
I wouldn't let a sweet potato dictate decisions, ever.
But what about teams like the cavs? They are clearly a terrible terrible team, but they gotta wait longer to rebuild with a 3 year average.
So $0.50 for that GIF? I think I'll pass.
That boy ain‚Äôt right
i am retarded
Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons.
How insulting . . . to Beavis and Butthead
I'd punt her to another planet if she said that about my dog. Wtf is wrong with people. üò†
Thanks dude. Shit happens!
the world is becoming very boring...
You cannot have your car running while you're pumping gas.
This report is going to be bullet proof
Ooh, I wanna be [NAME]!
Idk why youre downvoted, executing a manequin seems fun
Thanks man I will check into it.
Yeah I'm in the same boat regarding DC, its hard to imagine living in many other places in the country for me at this point.
Fine, you're right, they should just have a random fascist activist.
I‚Äôm still waiting for two of mine as well. This gives me hope that it‚Äôs still on its way.. :)
Stop calling them immigrants, that‚Äôs a lie. The term is ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù.
"I'm more concerned that the kid's name is ""[NAME]""."
Even though it was fake, the Olive Garden commercial was pretty good.
genji dmg buffs are eh but everything else except a nerf to zen are crazy
I know you're annoyed, but can this sub not be a place to post screenshots of poor opinions from the other sub? It's getting overwhelming.
You know what, I think we're gonna be friends. *Special* friends. 
I Play on ps4 so thats a Little uncomfortable but thanks
The whole team looks awful yet half the comments in here are still targeting one player.
"I dated a girl from Broomfield Colorado. She'd end sentences with ""yo"". I ended us."
That awkward moment wHen someone already used shell as a pun earlier
I liked the charlie one more.
That's great to hear, we need more Maki lovers
I'm hoping it turns out and theres something of value but these type of things spark up from time to time so time will tell.
Oh hi [NAME]
it's not but damn i'm sorry to hear how common this is
Have faith, I'm sure there is enough fan support for more popular characters to be brought back. 
Good luck using north melbourne when they change it to 'west' and make a new north melbourne station
Would it make you feel any better, little girl, if they was pushed out of windows?
I wish I didn't know that...üòî
These leaks are actually very credible. It's sad that you guys let Hate and anger blind you from enjoying the experience.
If you had to think of a way to survive this how the hell would you. Damn
Nice try Lumi
Thank you! I was thinking, man, I‚Äôve never been corrected about this before. üòê
If the issue is Abortion yes. My generation was genocided.
I am like the panda one, thanks! I'm also following [NAME] memes and while it def isnt all recovery stuff it's highly relatable 
Sorry, should've mentioned... 
Love when the run away joke always ends up with someone who isn‚Äôt funny ruining it
I know right! Lego really hurts!
The Young turds are especially bad and they‚Äôre not even sly about it either.
:( im sorry
Poor wee thing is probably terrified somewhere.
Goodbye cruel world.
Presidents using these robots will loose all legetimacy. They will become dictators. People should invest in good cameras to document the events and share it everywhere.
[NAME] giving us an iconic HUH! HUH! I'm acting moment LMAO.
read that as 'Belly Racing' and tbh i'm a little underwhelmed
Yeah, I was very sad to read that!
I love this, if I ever get the chance to travel to California I am hitting these spots!
"This feels more like ""Lofi Rock"" if that exists, or even Jazz. Very interesting."
Stupid democrats!!!!!!!
Mozzarella sticks!
If you find it I'm definitely sending it to my sibling. There's a special love for the weird in my family
Thanks, guys! Most of what you guys said were helpful. I'll work on myself a bit and not try too hard. ‚ò∫
Since it's a very unlucky case i would tell you to just have a really big amount of pacience and maybe have a date once a time
The shitty taste is what keeps you awake.
Better to spend the weekend in jail than get convicted of something you didn't do.
never, because I actually married someone I wanted to be with l, and didn‚Äôt fucking betray their trust, unlike you arseholes 
No. Can‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs legal here
Must be a terrible swim team. The only thing that your neck beard does is accentuates your double chin.
I guess electronic was not in the top 20. The legendary [NAME] with his 2 excellent performances got the #5
No problem, good luck
I wonder what the laws are if you bartered for a gun. I wash your car, you give me a glock.
Sad because you don't get any women?
> a GURPS game, inspired by anime and taking place in space yikes.jpg > I got pumped hahaha ok
Watching this makes me angry.
I thought it got a nerf when the spirit got released. My bad. But I still stand by, healing against the legion is pointless. 
Most of them don't technically breach the actual law, to my knowledge. Plenty of them are distasteful to me personally though.
True, I misread the post and thought it was applying it to on-field performance. My apologies.
Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
Thank god. I thought he double jumped.
I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. I hope the therapy brings you back your husband.
Savannahs? Like 30 lb dogs in a cat skin and they look amazing to boot.
How to instantly look 20 years younger!
For me it's more about making my personal appearance a hobby more than just buying expensive stuff to have it
Being so rare and only giving you bad luck? Fake news
Wow I guess alcoholics and drug addicts done exist either! and everyone always makes logical great decisions!!
Why are you making questionable jokes at work? Unless you work in a comedy club, it really aint the place.
[NAME] has a fun instagram
Thank you. That's encouraging. I hope to find people like that to learn from.
Oh god, going to a social event with someone and never leaving their side is me at almost every social event I go to.
I guess this is place where we are thankful for Microsoft complexity.
I didn‚Äôt think it was possible for one Twitter account to be so obnoxious, but here it is.
Thank goodness I‚Äôm safe. Don‚Äôt sound so disappointed.
Oh, I know. I just don‚Äôt think that will go over so well. Lol
Snorting them might be what kept her from having a lethal overdose, snorting benzos is pretty much a waste as most of it barely absorbs.
I actually laughed at this
Bruh you don‚Äôt belong here
Well, I'm glad you're out of all that now. How awful. The way they act, they make you think healthy boundaries are you being hostile.
Thank you so much for this advice :) i'm just really worried about going through the process again
There is nothing more disgusting than those who put children in danger unless it is the people who allow them to do more harm.
I can't wait for the r/hockey GDT with the saltiest fanbase in Reddit. I think I'm just gonna stick to our sub tonight.
Ok I see what you mean. Thanks.
I remember just feeling sick watching this, [NAME] made me cringe hard, I found [NAME] hilarious and ru looked terrible 
But I love solids
It's not something i'm proud of, but I definitely fucked up that day.
You're being a total narc, bro. You're so narcoleptic.
Thank you.
Sorry, not from her. But from family and friends. We were open to each other about everything.
Oh such a embarrassing mistake, or was it?
And you can amend a tax return. She can‚Äôt amend a terrible life choice like that.
I read on a different post that he died shortly after of internal injuries.
Well, to them that probably was the polite term! That's funny though lol
In reality the kid said: ‚Äúfuck off noob, Genji grandmaster main here boiii‚Äù
Well, that sucks
YES!!!! I will never understand why some post rants complaining that they cant make $$ off another persons hard work.
Dirty Southern Wankers
Thank you! Yeah, I can see that. I'm just posting old work of mine, some of the resolution isn't that great- apologies!
[NAME] got used to be my favorite character. This is embarrassing beyond any stretch of the imagination.
A bad pun can be a real pick-me-up
ooh boy that guy went off the deep end and drowned
Will see,still better for Chelsea then [NAME] who looked completely lost and devoid of any confidence lately
Nicknames like that get me all hot and bothered.
Sucks to suck
omg [NAME] is so pretty
No worries! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :)
Unless they end up with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] (or similiar), this will be a huge failure. Yikes.
Those mindsets are extremely dangerous to our democracy.
Haha it‚Äôs funny cuz I‚Äôm 17 and still doing these haha...
Damn it. You beat me to pointing it out. XD
The problem is that rent controls and the prevention of urban infrastructure expansion is killing city renters. Which is what most cities do.
I feel like I'd actually really like the song all together
I hope not, i was just sharing what happened to my bud. GL man, hope you get it figured out
Holy shit that SSP was beautiful
Sitting here, waiting for the price to drop so i can buy more. I guess it's not gonna happen.
No worries, good luck!
>!This really crushed my soul!<
Wish I had the confidence of [NAME]
You seem fun
Omg. This is the real gem in this post. Thank you sir
Haha, glad someone was able to point you in the right direction then 
I love democracy.
No offense but you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Maybe you like neurotic, needy men, but the general populace does not.
because [NAME] awesome.
plz no foul trouble
The title is a lie. I dislike what the APA is doing as much as anyone else, but how bout we dont sensationalize it.
[NAME] leans so far forward when he skates we love a king of physics and momentum üò§
Sorry guys, I went a little far... You can read my apology post here.
"[NAME] "" haters gonna hate"" the most cringe I've seen of any politician. Worse than [NAME] benefit singing some working class song. "
Argument a month. I should be so lucky.
He‚Äôs bad
True. I just always enjoyed the atmosphere of that place. And a couple of the sandwiches weren't bad at all.
Was against Cal but yeah [NAME] had a cannon of a leg but was very inaccurate Also had terrible hair
Clouds aren‚Äôt pale they‚Äôre translucent but ok üëåüèΩ
LOL this lasted long.
Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!
Yep. Lots of younger generation are obsessed with their phones and emotionally rocky tend to engage in this behavior, especially women with their whole Instagram obsessions.
I‚Äôm laughing more that I feel I should st this but I just lost my leg so...
I'm worried he's too small. I love his quickness, but sub-170 is scary for a guy that'll be running over the middle.
That's unfortunate for you.
This made me laugh way harder than it should have
Lucky you, our low is only gonna be 3¬∞
Its a funny joke but it's delivered horribly
came here to find the person who hasn‚Äôt seen this movie so i could feel bad for them
Can't even put on dress pants now without turning back and checking for my parents.
Might get hate for this but I'm reeeeaaaaaally not a fan of [NAME]. I don't know why, but I just don't LIKE her
I know many bf who would be excited for that
This 2D-meets-3D feel has been in all Paper Mario games, they all have an interesting take on it.
Dont try to force her out of it. She will (probably) turn on you before she turns on him.
I don‚Äôt know anything about Israeli politics except that [NAME] is awful and I hope he loses.
But I feel like such a tool!
Man. I wanna be there to see his face! It‚Äôd be great. ü§£
Are you being stalked by anti-vaxxers? I‚Äôm so sorry that sucks so much
I suspect wilful idiocy to sell books and merchandise to the even more idiotic.
It would be exciting I guess.
There were lots of awkward silences. The farewell didn't seem natural.
Except they fucking awarded it a prize first. It went through vetting, beat the other applicants, won, then was removed as not being correct?
It‚Äôs a shame, I‚Äôve had numerous friends with disabilities but I‚Äôve never treated them any less then my friends without.
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
Don't worry, he won't be for long
Relax it's a joke. Everyone does some 90's at the end of their videos. Otherwise people will assume that you aren't sweaty enough.
Read this while pooping. Laughed WAY too hard! Thank you for that.
Lmao there referring to what [NAME] said in episode 3 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you had a giant rock on your land, and you couldn't stop people climbing, wouldn't you be pissed?
I was wrong about that one part. I've edited my comment to reflect my mistake. Thanks for posting the relevant bit of the bill.
I am bored of [NAME]. Next celebrity chef!

Thank you all for your responses! Some new info for me is giving me hope again lol see ya on the battlefield
Hope not. That would be a bad decision.
that was a horrible call
I'm sorry to tell you this but your mate probably touches children too. That's the only logical conclusion I can come to here.
I'm sorry but this sounds very much purposeful. How exactly is headbutting someone an accident?
One my favorite seasons to rewatch. All the glorious fights. [NAME] is forever a queen
‚ÄúSpite-based refugee system...‚Äù really got me chucking.
[NAME] and [NAME] were awesome.
We should definitely ignore it and blame it on California.

Great point.
sorry this happened to you. id be sad and angry too if i worked hard on something, and someone took that away
Sucks that [NAME] won't get to play [NAME]

Change the initials to fake names. Was going to read but it‚Äôs too annoying.
I enjoy therapy...everyone's different I guess...I don't think there really is any other alternative....sexual abuse need professional help.
Yeah buh idk. I‚Äôd have to be really horny too and I‚Äôm really shy and anxious around him.
[NAME] and [NAME] should be there too E: Damn didn't think this would be unpopular lol
What was her emergency other than a teen throwing a temper tantrum
I'm on episode 8 and this is where the show has gotten boring af for me.
That makes me feel even pettier. Thanks!
Oh, what kind of material is for comedy cemetery? I never knew it was dif.
Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.
Bad defensive move by [NAME] there
This is cute.
Sadly, it was not
Oh, but amazingly it seemed to work out in the end because oil eating bacteria evolved in the Gulf of Mexico
Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants.
This is really disgusting, the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around, Shame that a few c*nts gotta do shit like this.
Thanks, I guess? Haha

Thanks, ive been thibking about telling the school principal, maybe itll help
I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?

I like [NAME] as a person I just don‚Äôt want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].
You are uninformed. Its not just because of the wall.
Write a reply by all means, but be gentle and respectful.
I was so scared to click that. Yet I did.
This is about as unacceptable as the subject can get.
Excuse me I am a very important person and I now think you're gay.
No TV Party for you üëé
Ok will do, but I listened to the ep right before I posted this.
Very good points. Thank you for sharing that!
"""I'm not the one constantly talking about getting laid, YOU are!"" "
How dare they not have the foresight to realize he'll become a president we don't like decades later.
The Square. The gross pretentious privilege in this film made me want to puke.
They look damn good for being in their late 40's/early 50's.
I stopped trying a long time ago. I actually feel much better (most days anyway)
Funk Night @ Marble Bar is Friday, 1/25. Always a good time and only $5 to get in.
My father has been dead for two years and it's still been difficult to not talk about him as if he's still alive.
Very very very naive.
You look chunky
It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.
Doing a happy dance! Yay!
No surprise there. It was always his policy to table it upon the deal's failure in Parliament as was set out at the Labour conference.
That cat's jump when the coyote takes his eyes off him.. Ouch!
What a joke
Thanks for reminding me to never live in NYC
It's barely a jumpscare tho, i dont get how this could be startling at all
">""Le Painting""??? What hell is that? - [NAME], 2019"
Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking.
Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play
well there's a pretty damning set of pictures there, ace.
Any food shortages will be caused by these idiots each buying 38 tins of beans a few days before we leave.
I also remember the scripts stating [NAME] look was one of jealousy, which disappoints me.
Oh shit right. I forgot about that wonderfully horrible fact haha.
stupid science bitches
And Meteor Man Edit: Hancock was a superhero movie too even though it was terrible.
I was looking forward to seeing the new predator, this (the concept, not the spoiler) would have made me dissapointed, yet intrigued
Of all the injustices in the world!
Nice dude, aimheros just what I've used.never heard of kovaaks. Thanks for the tip, I'll give it a try tonight.

She's a pro-Assad piece of shit.
So sounds like she was raped, and she seriously needs to press charges, this bartender needs to be raped in prison big time.
Natural or not monopolies aren't good.
[NAME] turned it into one, because they insisnt on being on the wrong side of history for every single god damn issue.
"But still, crying ""castrate all pedophiles"" because they could be potential rapists is like crying ""kill all men, they are all potential rapists."" "
What is up with the second, slightly differently orange hairline in front of the other from hairline? What the hell is going on there?
Your right i will talk to him tonight
I don‚Äôt understand your question, why are you nervous if you are happy with the arrangement and he seems interested? 
I actually got banned from vanilla sites for stuff like this lol. I think the guys get offended and flag your profile lol

Agree. Not a perfect coach but pretty, pretty good 
First of all, that's not true in any sense of the terms. Second of all, I'm not a national socialist lmao

Stop giving panhandlers money. They dont need it.
this season has already become my favorite over '12-'13 (yes I know '08-'09 was better but I enjoyed watching the '13 team more)
Sad. My condolences to her family.
i miss this show so much
The fact that you stayed this long really doesn‚Äôt but the blame on him, you chose this relationship 
[NAME] was autistic BOOM
Happy cake day!
Biting the hand that feeds them
Nice! I‚Äôm glad you liked it. Have fun exploring :)
I am sorry but you dont have a saying in this matter. Its up to your parents to solve this.
Glad your happy but also what
But then they can't draw the m word
If you think he's working 2400 times harder than an average minimum wage worker then there's something severely wrong with your world view.
Haha. You are crazy. The world, and reddit world is filled with crazies and weirdos. You are a brave, brave soul. 
We needed some way to torture a guy so a religion can be created.
We sacrifice them both to [NAME] and throw them in the Baler!
I think it's normal and fine and would second the suggestion to have her check into a weighted blanket.
I'm always stuck in platinum because every match is a loss, no healer what so ever
OMG are you serious? Do you know what episode? That's horrendous! I'm really disappointed in [NAME] on that one.
[NAME] had some pretty harsh words.
Someone who‚Äôs to sad and empty to care about toast... me I guess?
So did mine! And I'm now one myself. Sending a trillion hugs and props to you!
This is one of my favorite details/hidden views in the entire city.
I find that kind of thing really funny too!
But she spells oddly well, and these aren't small words. It's a bunch of interrupted/disjointed thoughts. 
That‚Äôs a cool steering wheel cover
They‚Äôre well on track to getting that superpower by 2020 slot
"Yeah I probably would've started crying on the spot. Loud, sudden and especially shrill noises are extremely *""cringey""* and uncomfortable and stressful"
[NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
Made my day!
Shame. CLG [NAME] could've been a thing.
That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
i communicate through morse code by constantly crouching and standing up. I generally prefer explaining how my oponent can improve when i beat them badly
MAKE A MORE DETAILED STORY OF THAT. ALSO MAKE UR OWN SUBREDDIT (r/amusementparkshenanigans). UR A GOOD STORYTELLER
[NAME] does love [NAME] I absolutely love Turkey- it's a shame I don't see myself visiting any time soon
This sub is so edgy
"If I hear ""not sorry, [NAME]"" one more time, I'm going to start disliking [NAME]"
Confirmation sounds really scary and sketchy. I can not not think about cults and rituals everytime...
"5'11"" [NAME]. He's basically 6 foot, so I must be missing something here."
The ‚Äútargets‚Äù so far has been guilty.
My score per minute is terrible because I only snipe so asking the wrong person. Sorry dude
praise be to the dark mother!
The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!
"Yeah, I was like ""man I love [NAME] so much but [NAME] is also amazing and good"""
I‚Äôm sorry should I have brought my make-up wipes and washed my face during my MRI? Or my ultrasound? Find some peace, man. 
Just wait until we sign [NAME] this off-season! Best front in the league.
Noooo. I seriously did not know that. Yes, mind blown. 
And still so few go to college): Such a broken system.
sorry it was absolutely not like that
Looks like a long lost cousin of [NAME]
Ya did good, kid. 
Thank you! I am surprised with the amount of feedback I am getting. I was not careful with my word choice.
U can try. Maybe say u are busy now Thursday but Friday is still open. I mean u are not waiting for her forever right?
I don't find it awkward, it's relaxing and I want to enjoy having some else wash and cut my hair.
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.
Wow! Thanks! We‚Äôre working on it! Glad you liked it (this is [NAME], the [NAME] one)... appreciate your support!
u fucked up
Thanks! But I was only offered one batch today, it was reallly slow.
I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
Idk, but it is cringe so i posted it here lmao
This is brilliant!
You forgot about cats. They‚Äôre all talking about their cats.
when my egg cracked I went through like every teen girl phase in the space of 2 months lol
Impossible. A Milford man shall neither be seen, nor heard. 
That‚Äôs kind of what we feel. But yeah $12 an hour, cost of living sucks though. 
Sounds like you're in a good place. I'm happy for you. For me... Right now I don't care how my STBXH is doing. Hahaha.
It developed because of my childhood and robbed me of a good bit of good stuff as an adult.
I peed off my deck at -30 yesterday, very disappointed when it didn‚Äôt freeze before impact.
Thank you. Let's see if it does :)
Cool story bro.
We're like bad luck lightning rods. Everybody around us is safe
> since he was the one to take it away from [NAME] last season [NAME] didn't deserve it last season
"""Talk about vaccines again and your next shot will be from my gun... of crystals bathed in essential oils"""
I dont go because it ends 1 of 2 ways. Either im sick or im not. I dont like either of those answers.
True but also it's not a dilemma ; if they try something like Tiananmen they will likely die. So not very tempting to try to change things.
Cause as soon as he locked in execution he used the auto typing function immediately celebrating. Gets punished by karma and im the one down voted. Sure
Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely
It is not selfish to end a relationship that is causing you great stress and you feel is over despite loving them.
Let‚Äôs not get creative again
Lol I felt like I was reading my own tinder story...
My own worst enemy singalong is my favorite LOL
>+. I‚Äôm in my early 3 Exactly This. It's the worst.
Sadly, I‚Äôm younger. 15.
I loved it so much! I really wish they had better paths for [NAME] though. Poor guy!
Yeah highkey looks decent
Democrats never had complete control, that is a common misconception/lie.
He‚Äôs a coward, but no need to ruin his life. You should feel sorry for him. 
happy cake day!
I like Chick-Fil-A but I don't go because of their political stances against gay/trans people.
So sorry for taking forever. Do you have an Apple device? I have given up on converting to google sheets.
 Turkey's situation is bad, but still nothing compared to Venezuela. 
For a long time he had no experience of going to the later rounds. Now that he has been there, he hopefully knows better than to be wasteful
I doubt [NAME] could do make up as well as a drag queen. He's not really good at anything.
Lol at the caption, but I believe it‚Äôs Netflix‚Äôs new original movie Close.
HEY! NO OC IN r/ComedyCemetery
THANK YOU!
‚ÄúThat ad is an over-generalization!‚Äù ‚ÄúMost men feel this way and agree with me!‚Äù Hm. ü§î
I can see that. Ffs who the hell would expect a Dean to recognize 2 people out of 25,000 people lol.
This picture is from before 2010. It was funny at the time.
Don't post this on Yelp. She'll hate you for life!
Love the Ana's that peek snipe and get wrecked by [NAME], [NAME] or [NAME]. Good times.
I'm not vegan cause I love animals, I'm vegan cause I hate myself. 
*Super Dark Times* was awesome. Those kids were great actors. They really tuned in on the bleakness of the situation.
How can he be cool? Pretty sure he has sexually harassed women.
All this theft should be reported to the school so it can go on his spermanent record
-_- GOOD FOR YOU.
You‚Äôre not going to win, so you have nothing to worry about. 
Looks like modern art tbh but its good
Heck, you're one cool dude, guy. 
Ugh, this is so beautiful. The richness in those colors. It makes me wanna cry. 
"Don't ""neg"" the university (or any university) and don't write about doing illegal, unethical, or immoral activities. "
I was so hyped after the zach shot, I'm still crying 
‚ÄúReal men‚Äù. [NAME] be more offensive.
Ah yes, the standard midwestern transplant rite of passage. ‚ÄúTHIS ISNT COLD LOL IM FROM WESHUBEKAUAN MINNESOTA AND YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT COLD IS‚Äù
Great concept but, there is going to be a Danganrompa 4
You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can‚Äôt eat that.
I can't believe you're giving these trolls the time of day but good on ya bud. Epic post.
Gonna give up your best friend for a g huh? I'm glad we aren't friends.
great!! thank you
You're going to seriously regret this in a few years.
Been spamming [NAME] in gold/plat elo, nashors into lich bane then hourglass is disgusting if you play it right.
He was aggrieved that people didn‚Äôt recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.
Death treats are for immature people, I'm sorry you received them. Comparing you to flat earthers is not far off though.
Not to assume things here but why would you gas yourself over [NAME], kid is a fucking monster
Again, that + is going to make people not want to do this deal.
Man I didn't think our fanbase was this delusional.
A car. Let someone else eat the immediate depreciation and break it in for you.
Unite us. Unite the clans.
great for on the go! but i‚Äôll always smoke glass if i‚Äôm home :)
Why do you use your valuable time to hate? We only got time to love each other and ourselves.
I love this sub. You are my people. ;)
I think transparency was the right move here. The guy ghosted you for a while anyway so it doesn't seem like much of a loss.
Poor [NAME] she just broke her back
Ah, thanks. 
I would have laughed it off and walked away. Last thing I would do is ask the internet if I was right or wrong.
I would love to be cut open for no reason while I miss work spending weeks, and possibly even years, recovering!
[NAME] don‚Äôt make up only 2% of the population though. Edit: I mis-read. I‚Äôm sorry. Please ignore this comment.
All of Disney is cringey. It needs to be stopped
Well tickle me pink. Thanks for following up, I enjoyed the read.
I love the book - much better than the movie imo!
Probably fake. In most situations Siri will tend to avoid words like penis and hope you're saying pianist
you are two hot cuties, all the bestest!
Damn, chairs can communicate with eachother now? What a time to be alive!
Yo good for you!
"I mean, okay...I don't support those so-called ""religious liberty"" laws, soo...there's that."
"""Sigh"" I thought you were better than this I thought we were over this but no you just had to do it ""Upvotes angrily"""
Having high empathy is great, but I'm still trying to figure out what to do with it.
If you've got a problem with [NAME], then you've got a problem with me and I suggest you let that one marinate
Well thank you for all that you are doing. Have you considered becoming a dispatcher too while you are at it? Haha
He seems to have a really cool fashion sense, maybe he can do something with it one day, maybe go to Paris?
I fat fingered it haha I meant 18
Right on. Thanks!
[NAME] made boobi beautiful
Sorry to hear that
That‚Äôs a lazy argument. Racism can be defeated with good education and proper parenting but most people are too lazy to fight for it.
yeah. it's like you know something real bad is gonna happen at any time. that's why I never try to get my hopes up too much.
It‚Äôs an 05 and we don‚Äôt know when the battery was last repacked lol
Steven universe is a kid‚Äôs show that is also aimed at adults. A very intense 1 hot episode aired last night and people are excited.
There are some amazingly cringey compilations of terrible dialogue from this show on yt
My mother did this. This isn't just a millennial thing.
Or that's just another terrible problem with the template
Okay I will, thanks so much you are helpful. I don‚Äôt even know if she is into me or anything but... I will see. 
I think I had that thought years ago, but then I heard they were making a third trailer park boys movie, so I wanted to see that. 
Your pedo-tache is only the fourth worst thing about your face.
She said on the VR Aftershow that she had hooked up with girls and had a relationship with a girl before.
This is painful
This made me soooo uncomfortable yikes
No, you won the 23rd.
GG. We played as best as we could. Utah just a better team.
So cool! Me and my sissy got the same but on our arms! On twitter!
Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!
Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
Upvoted twice because this is EXACTLY what they think it is and it sucks rat balls.
Italy would be so awesome - I think it's one of those countries you'll just instantly fall in love with.
Wow this made my forehead hurt it was so cringey. I love it.
Bump stocks too I guess, I can't imagine why he actually did that though, perhaps his advisors told him to do it to pander
That was the most boring movie I‚Äôve ever seen
Meh, it‚Äôs ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù over there. I‚Äôll be worried when they stop making it to the playoffs. 
I love having a deep bench, and being able to have really solid players step in when we have injuries. [NAME] was solid.
Thanks i really appreciate it.
Okay but beware of top experts. You know what you need and what's right.
Last three times have been lost Final, won Final, lost ECF, which is insane. Just a shame that's over the course of 17 years
Omg I love these kinds of dates. Who initiated ??
"OMG its youuuuuuu u/Sippinthatminttea. I remember you üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ ""interesting creature"" üòã üòÇ "
If I‚Äôd know about his kin shit I would have never been friends with him in the first place
I learned that recently driving into SLC for the first time in the rain/snow. I couldn't see shit. 1/10 Was scary.
Whoa. I appreciated this, thank you.
It's almost a shame we won't get a second leave/remain referendum because it would be fascinating to see the result.
Go cry somewhere else please.
Everytime I confront her about she gets super pissed and things I‚Äôm ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù.
Finally somewhere where I'm just an average fucking person Fuck why am I crying
My neighborhood is majority Haredi dude. Getting upset when a minority moves in is bigotry.
The only winner here is this guys future divorce lawyer.
I genuinely just for once want to be in a situation where everyone applauds. That‚Äôs my New Years resolution.
I've never been so proud of humanity.
Ahhhh That's rich.
Professionally.... no way I could do that to myself
Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
Ignorance, Illustrated
I got a weird vibe when he was placed on Colliton's staff, so I'm really glad it's turned out the way it did. 
*lol whats a calculator isnt that a person that calculates why would they have letters on them*
Based on that cars wheels it is now very tired.
It's hard to say. They are an above average team that often looks lifeless and underachieves.
I have two and nothing has ever happened to me. The media doesn't want you to show your support because they want supporters to feel isolated.
Except I can‚Äôt with the mobile app. Reddit doesn‚Äôt allow you highlight
That's just the adrenaline. It'll set in soon, haha
I know right?! My parents are extremely proud & grateful they don't have to help me pay debt.
It's already a thing though lol
I'm mostly impressed that you can get to work from West Seattle in 20 minutes by car.
[NAME] sure are afraid of brown women.
i never liked any star trek but its great listening to them talk about this dumbster fire
Your opinion doesn't matter, the judge's does. Like I said, if you want better answers, then consult a family law attorney in your area.
Perfect, thank you!! [NAME] this week and [NAME] next week, I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to having them all!! :)
Respect from me for his acting abilities! Underused, to say the least.
The pink hats in here will tell us something different but we know the truth. Thanks for the comment
The puppy is actually suggesting that the use of laptop to be repulsive. ^^^^PCMR4Lyfe
Welcome to CTH where everyone pretends that socialism will work, next time.
unbridled bigotry that started as a meme but ended... well, it hasn't yet but its not looking good
She's actually not dead at all. Even now shes still a good hero.
Fuuuuuuuuuck that.
ooohhh this seems quite clever, i'll try this out. thanks! 
I wish. I got to revisit all the cringy things I liked in middle school. There were almost 1000 pictures and literally 700 of them were memes
Yes!!! He was my #2 choice. Love this hire so much and we don‚Äôt have a coach with a sketchy past
That‚Äôs a really cool GMC van there, love seeing really old, unusual vehicles like that around town.
But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*
Accidentally clip through a bathroom wall, get slapped
I wish my husband was like you, especially on point number 6
awesome thank u!!
Are you saying only corrupt companies make a profit? That doesn't sound right to me.
It doesn't cost money to organize. It costs time, effort and concern for your country.
I thought I could handle it but I was wrong. Good [NAME] was I wrong.
They are the best but my office is so far away üòû
Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.
I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
This type of discussion is exactly what I came to r/medicine for. Thanks guys!
Ok. Got it. Thanks
His hair looks fucking horrible üòÇ
My shirt is [NAME]. My balloon popper is the DNC. And then [NAME] is the fire under my ass to dive deeper ever day.
Wow thanks I gotta try this!
Yeah I know day of the dead is real thing but they way [NAME] portrayed it was so much better than anything I've seen
Oh my heck, thanks so much for correcting me. üòÜ
Good ol best available dasher
Right? I was kind of hoping [NAME] would get to take a crack at it.
The most irrelevant comment award..... goes to..... no one else but you.
you have [NAME], you'll live.
Wow your post history is toxic.
Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend
for how long, you arent fucking with me?
I always compared him to [NAME].
Thank you! It makes so much more sense
I miss him...
I don't want a president who doesnt know anything about foreign affairs....no thanks.
I don't even have a desktop PC, so I don't think being able to play on a computer will really be possible
Keep voting against your own interests. #maga!
I am the same way. I feel your pain! Therapy and meds are helping me!
Try the Gourds passed gin and juice. They‚Äôre awesome also the [NAME] are great
old school from back when we won the cup
>I think any progressive would be against laws that force anyone to say anything. You thought wrong.
Better start believing in miracles then! LOL
The game is riddled with error messages.
I really don't think healthy people with no other emotional issues regret having their kids.
This one is the worst, by far
Lol hows that different then [NAME]
This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet.
Maybe you need some time get loss of that thought. Try to ignore it and just enjoy your luck.
Samsies! I could have written the feels in this post. It's like the job I never ever wanted and got and now I've tenure
But that jumper looks hella cosy
As long as the stop watch on my iPhone is timing him, my kid will do almost any chore. Its crazy what kids find exciting
I am in fact a woman, but I'm not bothered by the assumption. Thank you :)
I use Firefox with my 5 extensions and one tab, 400MB of RAM being used. I use Chrome with the same conditions, a whole fucking gigabyte. 
I like that [NAME] is still [NAME]
Still pretty embarrasing though :p
Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
I would have tactically thrown dynamite and blown my self up about 2 seconds in.
Volume-wise, you are correct. 
I'm sorry but data and facts are more important than the emotional experience of having lived through something.
I figured it would be ‚Äúthe joke is always real in the comments.‚Äù
It better not as I only bought the bloody thing last week! Sorry, guess i'm still in shock from the kettle dying.
If you don‚Äôt include AZ in your 3, you‚Äôre wrong. 
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this morning in my head I kept saying let go of the resentment this is amazing
[NAME] way of doing things is straight trash for [NAME] lol. The latter end of the competition being bottom is a default sometimes.
I just picked it back up after getting a pro controller for Christmas.. holy crap it's great!!
I met up with a woman who was 49. She reminded me of being old. That isn't attractive. Youth makes you feel alive.
you are delucional.
Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Maybe a different sentence, but the same page.
I haven't seen the chet response, but I cannot imagine myself not telling that person to go to hell and enjoy a lone existence.
He‚Äôs so eager to please! This trait in dogs is so endearing.
Man. Really bad last possession there. Bummer.
Focus groups thought [NAME] was too attractive and the brethren were experiencing a burning in their loins and sinews so we fixed it.
You need to look up what flaming is. Don't get offended just because I'm calling out 14 year old boys like you.
definitly whining my dude
She was literally the worst manager I‚Äôve ever worked for
By [NAME]! By [NAME]! It's the grand Champion!
Officer [NAME] is the penultimate FA character. Apart from the fact he's attractive of course AAAAAAAAAAAAH
you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry
Ah geez what a disaster if she tries this!
That‚Äôs what makes this so sweet! Blackmailers are scum. This was satisfying to read. You‚Äôre a savage, OP. Well done! 
Ditto!!!
A lot of the tik tok meme songs actuallyüòÇ. They really make me laugh and hyped at the same time haha!
Yes, all the time when I can tell somebody is upset with me. Allistic peeps really refuse to communicate clearly it‚Äôs the worst!
This is dangerous.
shut your deregulating lying mouth bill
Was just thinking that. Great tunes
He looked so sad when he was talking about how it feels to be getting criticised üò¢.
Gonna be at the game! Let's get this win boys!
Even on steroids of all kinds in high doses there is no way that this is done in 16 weeks
This hurts me more than the fan meme.
You know, that never occurred to me! So keep cool in summer, warm in winter?
Happy Cake day.
Who the hell is that. I only got my account 2 months ago
Wwwhhhhyyyyy do they keep forcing [NAME] down our throats. [NAME]!
Guess I'm seriously out of shape, I should do something about that. Maybe next week...
[NAME] insulting his fanbase has literally been a hallmark of his persona from the beginning of barstool
Subpoena is still one of the weirdest words I‚Äôve ever seen
Love [NAME] more.
Haha! I remember seeing this when it aired
Phone calls are the ultimate nightmare !!
‚ÄúI doubt I‚Äôm done writing‚Äù Kill me
Agree completely with this statement
Another senseless tragedy.
Fuck that, he can go to Cleveland with [NAME] on that bullshit.
That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. 
[NAME] just has the runs. Don't worry, [NAME] is lacing up to replace him
Well this all started Wednesday. But I‚Äôve been unhappy with my life for weeks now
I get needing a good education but what is with people acting like spending the most per student is a badge of honor?
From heroic cancer survivor to bad Italian boy. What a world we love in
A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
I'm with you, pulju has been looking dangerous lately
Pffft right, next you'll tell me America isn't a representative democracy, or that England isn't a monarchy! Don't be a fool! 
Good for you- take it to the next level! Congratulations
I didn‚Äôt like him before this, now I really don‚Äôt like him. 
And Mac and cheese is shit too. If a grown man has to eat children's food, then STAHMs can get minimum wage jobs
He had another fight with cancer. I believe he is ok now but chemo is very very nasty.
Too bad it wasn‚Äôt a sword.
Bad luck you‚Äôre in Beckton
I'm late to the party but she looks like she could get up!!
No phone, can't help....sorry?
I don't think we can threaten them with something that's likely to be illegal to convince them.
holy mother of oof
Occupation badges are dumb and I‚Äôm sad they made the transition to OCP.
Perfect dynamite moment. Rank up those buckles.
Yeah, he's 8-1 in his last 9 games played. Pretty great if you ask me.
Their sounds of silence cover is very good
You forgot blue passports
Thank you! Definitely listening to this one.
Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
People done be ignorant
There's really no need to test for congenital defects with a mixed breed.
I love how he said he was moving on and then didn't move on. Classic [NAME]!!
Me too. I love it!
"The ""awesome"" shipping service that promises 2 days but still takes a week? Lol"
Enjoy your gold!
Coinbase LOL people think place is the answer. I think it‚Äôs Cancer.
USA Trash is [NAME] beloved gift to Canada. Thanks [NAME]. Nice hair though!
Yeah that's what I meant but I wrote it stupidly. Did you start with really low weight? Like really low?
Fuck this team
I would like to send you a card or an email for your next birthday if you would want that :)
I must be getting old. Much more likely to be horny at 2 pm.
That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
good luck stay safe!üíì
I hope you can get some relief soon, I can‚Äôt imagine how awful that must feel 
He's worth it I think. Dude brings it 110% every game
Wouldn't have it any other way. Fuck my DNA. Fuck nucleotides.
Thanks for sharing your thought. You have a fair and reasonable perspective. Happy New Year!
I like [NAME], but I'd just rather spend more time with [NAME].
It‚Äôs 2019 dude chill out with the gender roles Edit: it‚Äôs 2019 I‚Äôm tired sorry
Don‚Äôt waste money on guns, you‚Äôll be given all the best guns in the story
The suspension bridges are awesome on sunny days
Yes that is so true why didn‚Äôt I think of that
Opposites attract! I thought the same thing when he helped her cook Thanksgiving.
Your logic is pretty messed up and the pos assumption has zero to do with this. Centralized mining will cripple the ability to fight censorship.
Your pro controller tho, tops.
Give me sunshine from Clemson in a few years lol
Plus corporations are universally unethical
I‚Äôve had to remove fallen trees on snowy roads because the forest service is not working as much. Shits a little fucked.
Lol. Exactly
Yes it is I‚Äôm 99.9% sure! Thank you! Enjoy your gold.
No? Lol
Laugh all you want, it's pretty much indestructible now!
While I understand where you are coming from, this is a tad too aggressive.
I know! So relieved.
That was the worst power play I‚Äôve ever seen
I can take the Karma loss, I couldn't help but troll that other post a bit. Some will get it (like yourself).
Doordash pays less than minimum wage, no money even to buy cheesecake from the cheesecake factory after paying rent and Bills üò•
>No but I know that fat ass just says [NAME] man bad lol [NAME] is pretty fat. Good observation.
[NAME] damn you are autistic
That's amazing...I have to admit, Google making me do this while on VPN has moved me to Bing. 
I guess 14 years of customer service experience is good for something after all.
Once again if you base your worth/purpose on some base primal act, you're pathetic
What a pretty young lady
The coolest of beans my friend
It's all good. [NAME] was at my door 5 minutes later, and amazingly, didn't drive away between me seeing him, and walking downstairs. 
You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
Gotta cast a wide net to get those sweet, sweet clippings.
I agree. I could tell she was really upset.
I keep seeing you around and I love the art. I really want to get into drawing but I‚Äôm only good ad heads and faces.
I want a Doritos crown, too!
Yeah, my bad
Illegal workers have no rights, no recourse to the law in the face of mistreatment. Abusive employers like that.
>Congratufuckinglations Good one! You got a good chuckle out of me.
You nailed it!
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it think.
You sound fun at parties
And there's good reason for that. The SD is absolute shit
Omg this is too good.
A classic question. He wanted to create to share His love and existence.
I‚Äôm sorry to hear this. Unfortunately online dating is trying to find the bits of gold in a pile of pyrite
I don't play assassins much, but I love playing Rat.
I find sativa makes me paranoid/anxious as hell. Indica calms me down more. Smoking too much of any strain makes me anxious by time though
As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.
My girlfriend barely tolerates me showering in the morning, she'd be furious if I'd let an alarm ring while I'm away. And rightfully so. 
Bears are empathetic creatures? lol...
That poor girl. She wants to run in the rain and her mean ole momma won't let her. LOL
That sounds pretty good
They are probably waiting for his harasser to pull a [NAME]. Filthy men.
Thank [NAME] you used this prequel quote and not, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.‚Äù
"Bloody forking shirtballs! This has to be some kind of ""The Good Place"" / Bad Place repost robomod bullshort. "
Ya, because it‚Äôs funny and relatable
Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow.
that was a horrible fix
Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
Honestly just tired of this shit, people who'd rather see us tank than push for playoffs. Literally want us to be the fucking Suns.
No offense, but your parents are assholes.
Very sad. It‚Äôs the child I feel for most.
I just never felt like a boy. I hate my body and I just feel like I can't express myself for who I am.
I love posts like this because they make me feel so much better about being vegan.
Spending the day with family in beautiful Bowral üåø
I see so many different worlds in this! Love it
Thank you. This is well-written and it‚Äôs really helpful.
i agree to kill all children
Ok so how do I put money on this? Because I do not see Mac shelling out the goods to make that happen
Yep, sure is. Have things gotten better for you, though?
Me too dude. Nice video for what it was!
I‚Äôd want him to keep whatever gimmick this is it looks interesting
Happy cake day
It isn't complicated at all. You are growing up. Congrats.
This is amazing man. Congrats and keep em coming
There‚Äôs a cat sitting on my lap right now she‚Äôs so cute
Please stop cussing.
OP inserted the F into ‚Äúof‚Äù to make ‚Äúoff‚Äù and now it‚Äôs truly upsetting.
And she jumped into sewage. Yeh, no.
Let their deaths be swift
I love that
Wow you're so moral you've changed my outlook on remainers
Reddit is so right wing I can‚Äôt even believe it
She should be FIRED
No. You are not.
Its what keeps me going, I couldn't hurt my friends and family i love them too much
>Not all 70% of the filthy [NAME] money is gonna be taken. ...unfortunately.
I like you both.
Shit dude I thought I was Mr. [NAME]? Here have some beans lol
At least there‚Äôs still more likes than dislikes
So true it hurts.
Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]...
The last thing you wanted for your child, but they inevitably choose it. Funny that.
That's if you make the smallest payments possible, but if you just need to float a payment, then they will work. 
‚ÄúWe only let him jump around for 12 hours a day!‚Äù Wow. I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you.
Honey is a cutie! My aunt and uncle have a dog named Honey too. üíó
I tell them my wife died in a car accident 10 years ago and I couldn‚Äôt fall in love again. I‚Äôve never been married.
I am the proud owner of a Vernon Gholston jersey. My wife got it for me as a Christmas Gift our first year dating....
I think you also underestimate how big Chelsea has become, especially in the States
I am loving this exchange. At first I felt really really insecure that my sister and I are best friends and now I realize this person is ridiculous.
Sure. We can back another vote if it's found out that remain was illegally funded by [NAME], constantly lied.
Woah woah woah... people have different taste? Stop trying to give me some perspective!
Thank you! Do you know what agency would be interested in this information?
If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this.
Yeah...itd make people's lives easier if I was dead but didn't work out so here we are
It looks like it's from the Molecule Effect on Santa Fe. Great quirky spot!
I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.
Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list.
Well that‚Äôs not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
[NAME] is a traitor to this country.
I know, this weekend was absolute worse case scenario 
I like this sub, and I like you. You're alright. 
Congrats to you!! So happy for you! wow socks is sooo nice!
Yikes, what a loony bird.
Living is exhausting.
I like how the [NAME] stood there like what the fuck and then just accepted his death.
Good. Thanks everyone but finnaly some reading material. Many thanks
Hates the patriarchy...has an iPhone designed by a man. So hypocrite can be added to the list of bullshit that makes up your personality
You got shafted.
I think he's a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, lazy, wrathful, envious, and prideful man. 
¬£10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
It's sad that nearly everything seems ok as long as [NAME] told you to do it.
I would think terrible, awful things.
Wish you good luck
The denials is crazy in here
This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal.
oh gosh i heard about that and though it was absolutely disgusting
i luckily became really good friends with one. we definitely helped each other process our pain from him... so surreal how well they spin those lies
I agree. Verbatim.
If you‚Äôre going to be a psycho you might as well smile and make it look like you‚Äôre a happy one.
I got the exact same message from tati yesterday ! She said on her twitter that it's definitely a scam
r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
No, he‚Äôs been with more women than I have been with men. He loves sex and has no problems with an erection. 
I like all Star Trek. I hope they end up switching directions now and make new movies that are more about exploration.
Nope, try to keep up.
i wouldn't take that significant of a pay cut. you should keep your job and do your creative writing on the side/free time.
Mmh, I love the smell of thought policing in the morning. 
Probably stop school shootings hehe
[NAME]? He's an absolute fool. If we need a coach to destroy our organization from top to bottom, he's the man.
Omg! That's awesome thank you so much!
Which you ultimately pay for in higher insurance premiums, court costs, etc. Dealing with big problems like this is a net positive for everyone.
Wow I can't wait to use okcupid to get myself a nerd/loser girlfriend who'll eventually become fat
Its a weird thing they do south of the border... they throw flour at each other. No idea why that's a thing.
Very sure they are metal.
Meh, the liga that we all knew and loved went away when [NAME] fled to Italy
Oh no, not again! 
Oh yeah, it's really dehumanizing to have respect for people's private property and not steal it from them whenever we feel like it...
I respect your laziness.
I wish I had seen this as a teenager :(
My first Hawks jersey was #81. Praise be.
Ah, I love a quality rant, OP. Please keep up the good work! :)
I want 10 - 0. This organization deserves the embarrassment.
I agree with the last paragraph, it isn't there fault the other side didn't want to participate though. 
But we love how they enslave, rape and decimate civilizations in the name of [NAME]. You guys just don‚Äôt get it and are probably racist. 
"Claims to be ""against sexist [NAME] bros"" Hires a sexual abuser as her top advisor"
Wauw! Those weapons are awesome!!
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
Why is this downvoted? It‚Äôs right.
That was my first live Lions game (British and flights to DTW are expensive) I've never gone through so emotions in such a short amount of time
[NAME] probably won‚Äôt like that lol
Crafty little bastards.
For the night is dark and full of terrors!
Oh [NAME] it's [NAME] against dinosaurs again
Lived in multiple cities across the UK, never seen a bus service as consistent, cheap and generally amazing as Edinburghs.
np, good luck
Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
Wish we got power plays regularly.
Thank you I appreciate it
Well fuck my kids then
I mean, she actually is a genius, so I really dont have a problem with her identifying herself as one
And when I went to your moms house she told me about her super awesome witty son.
Worrying what other people think is what collectivists have brainwashed you to think and feel. You are just a coward making excuses for your cowardice.
21 million went to [NAME] throughout his tenure‚Ä¶ridiculous
No, treating it like it‚Äôs obligatory just means it‚Äôs a standard I have. People are allowed to have standards. 
I‚Äôm *BEGGING* that they get it right by the time [NAME] shows up.
y'know, I should try that haha... (music gets depressing) ha
What a terrible list
I wouldn‚Äôt call Sargent Peppers underrated by any stretch of the word
They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
Well damn.
Aren‚Äôt people on the internet the best! I don‚Äôt blame you for deleting, no time for negativity in this life. üçª 
This is the scariest thing I think I‚Äôve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
I would like to suggest one that's like Would You Rather. More of a dark comedy but oh so good. Cheap Thrills is amazing
Technology bad!
Im so sorry
Ah ok, nice one. Thanks.
Welcome to racial integration, where your civility standards are racist and you better shut up or else.
If you‚Äôre you and comfortable, you go, girl. 
Oh good point! I bet the farthest they go is reporting to credit agencies. Which still sucks but he can always fight that outside of court.
wow great news . happy for him
Yea we‚Äôre actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad
Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
Guys his username is [NAME]. I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs serious.
Wholesome and hilarious! Good job OP.
I can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs wooshing who but I‚Äôm afraid to ask by this point
Holy shit.....just holy shit
I would see a doctor asap and get to a psychiatrist. Hallucinations of any kind are worrisome.
I have a feeling this is gonna get really crowded, and end up being a shit show with such short notice for everything.
Seize all his property and assets. Redistribute to homeless and single mothers/fathers. He loves food banks, let him use them. 
im glad to know that it's not that likely that I'll be sent immediately. thank you for the kind words :)
I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.
Grandmas knees are burning up
Could do even better by kicking out anything north of Cambridge or west of Oxford.
I'd be happy to make a donation if you've got some left!
I mean, two times zero is zero and that can be a guarantee :D
I don't know why that omni-directional treadmill in Ready Player One still isn't being mass produced.
No, just dont show off your books. 
That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
That's some creepy coincidence, then! Maybe I'll find my Donut twin on here one day! üòÆ One can only hope...
Just watching this happen upsets me ~_~
Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
NOO HES SO ANGRY
Damn i guess people shouldn't steal. Or smoke
He's being so unprofessional. He's out for blood for some reason.
TIL [NAME] is a real girl
Definitely don‚Äôt rush. That‚Äôs how unfortunate decisions happen, and then you‚Äôre linked to that person for the rest of your life.
yes, because I like her already anyway
[NAME], I could‚Äôve written the last part, and the first part serves as a potent warning.m that I needed to hear. Thank you.
Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.
Those got me once when I was about 6 because I wanted to go up two steps at a time. I still do that to this day...
Why is it that young girls seem to idolise serial killers? I had a friend like this and never understood the attraction. It's scary
Not tryna plug or anything but i use InShot to crop my videos and it works fine It just makes me hurt inside seeing a screen record not cropped
I CANTTTTüò≠üò≠üò≠. That's as bad as you said, it will get better friend. r/oldpeoplereddit.
[NAME] was the best, sweetest, most deep-feeling man to ever be on the show. I will fight anyone who says otherwise. 
Ugh, thanks. I'm still working through it emotionally üòÇüòÇ so funny about worrying over the stain! 
Wait did he actually do this? Seems like it would be insanely disrespectful to you fellow craftsmen.
Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
Try to keep yourself busy with other things to forget the thoughts.
That's why everyone loves you, you're a joke club. 
Maybe its the picture but the fabric looks really bad
Hurts donuts are dry. i love the toppings and suffer through the bottom 90% of the donut, really not worth it. 
"Im not saying it wont be self titled, I could totally see that. What just asking how he knew it was ""fact"""
Kraft is the wrong kind of ass though. Even the generic stuff is better than kraft.
i love you [NAME] and and son [NAME] and the holy spirit love
[NAME] was attractive physically and got a match. [NAME] wasn't unattractive in his behavior and got an invitation for sex.
Oh so it is a separate guy filming, it‚Äôs actually impressive how synced up their speeds are
Shoot i posted this in the wrong place. Here you are several sources. Happened last summer.
4-25 against teams with winning records. 0-7 on Monday Night Football. The guy can't show up when it matters.
This is not a good relationship. It doesn't seem like she is ever good to you, only manipulative.
Am an FX artist. This is fake. Scar wax gives it away so badly.
Argh. The most stupid and needless abuse of power teachers do. Some particularly stupid ones at least.
He got It from his moma
You are actually an idiot. Not it is not a proven fact, it is a biased stereotype. It is definitely derogatory. 
US labor laws are fucked up
Yeah probably should've chosen a better sub, but I couldn't think of one
I'm sorry but I would've have pressed charges on the guy who kicked me in the ribs while I was being held down.
Patience. Give it another day or so. Send a text telling her you enjoyed her company and wanna do it again. Hopefully she responds
Shut up, or you'll be tossed off the roof!
This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever
This is nasty NSFW
Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
As funny as a sinking school bus.
Worst radio ever.
I am real excited for this, I just hope they don‚Äôt ruin it.
Your uncle sounds fun. RIP indeed
Great idea! So he can get arrested or hospitalized or both.
Yeah I agree people on reddit are so extra it's annoying
Omg [NAME] he‚Äôs there because you don‚Äôt listen. You ass!
I'm sorry but as someone who travels alone I would be pissed if I was told I can't drink at the bar by myself.
I would love to see an [NAME] cosplay!
Seattle has both, and is building a huge extension to the existing light rail system. Traffic is still absolutely fucked.
This entire discussion is very unnecessary
I'm all for finding ways of reducing gun violence but this seems to just be arbitrary and capricious.
You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
One of things I loved about this subreddit is the use of the old school meme format
I'm with the photo guy. It would be an awful feeling to watch your date flirt with some other dude ON YOUR DATE.
Yeah people used it as precedence. That‚Äôs very sad. What‚Äôs your point? What abhorrent treatment?
He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He‚Äôs an awful person
Cognitive Dissonance. Big problem in our society.
To be fair, the world (especially politics) has been kind of a shit show since 2016
No. I'm just against forcing your beliefs on people who aren't old enough to distinguish reality from fiction.
Oh you just love to see that
I bet he took down his USA flag to put this one up instead lol
It is true. But the real reason for the problem is the selfishness of the people.
The best thing about it is that it's tons of people that didn't know he existed 2 months ago and have never watched him play.
It's the first two themes in the themes section lol - what game did you get :)
That's so great! Plus it feels good to know I helped Pfizer make $5B last year on Prevnar 13.
I love [NAME]
Thank you! Much appreciated, as promised.
im in love with this comment
Block her.
Just get on good ol reddit and have the nice people decide what you do.
Alas, Windows, so I'll go a-hunting. Thanks for the info, though!
If you don't patent, then don't complain
this is the perfect example of something that is a terrible combination without being outright disgusting.
Look at you, Mr Independent! You're such a big boy! I'm so proud of you!
To bad trophy wife doesn't have 4th place.
I'm saying put up or shut up. If you can't back up your point with evidence, your opinion is worthless. 
They weren‚Äôt even that good mostly don‚Äôt @ me
Don't forget colors. They panic at the sight of a chess board.
[NAME] is a fantastic player, but would he be a regular starter over at Juve? He needs to stay at Arsenal.
I feel like people who post these are too in denial to realize it looks like a cry for help
Damn I never had to wait that long. Then again where I live is a town more than a city so much less busy etc
[NAME] FINALLY fournier, [NAME]
No. Arizona would be more useless than Italy. Let them win their own battles first before they help us fight ours.
Yeah, might just grab a coffee and be done with it.
Please tell me that [NAME] never said this.
Yeah there's no reason to believe you staying up as a kid has anything to do with your current insomnia
They‚Äôre usually not great actually. I‚Äôm shocked at this post. Must have gotten pointers from the Bills social guy cause he‚Äôs great
Do you feel better now?
You are correct.
The state should kill them yes, you seem to have a very low IQ and can‚Äôt grasp [RELIGION]. No wonder you took up Reddit Atheism
I hope you and your retarded phone have a nice day!
Alright dude just fuck off ok, it's not the funniest thing on the internet but it did make me smile so in conclusion fuck you
To be fair, they did call it a horror. 
"Ahhh a fellow atheist, I used that in the standard social meaning but no intention of meaning ""god"" would actually bless you lol but thx "
[NAME] actually just released an awesome video on the self help industry and it's relationship to these folks!
Don't stop cold turkey. It's dangerous and you can have deadly seizures. Taper down if you are going to quit any benzo.
It never ends well
like 2lbs worth of potato and toppings at her grandmas every damn day. I love that show as well
Honest to [NAME] make it stop, it's old news at this point omg.
[NAME] good one i like that
Ladies and gents, I present to you, your typical anti-gunner.
Yes it is child abuse. It‚Äôs sexist too.
Another reunion pic!!! made me lol
You sound like a douche.
"""If you don't support no go zones, you are racist!"""
HOLY MOTHER DUCKER
I have endured worse.
Thanks for the laugh
Don‚Äôt worry it will work at some point haha.
Bet you don't even get ¬£400, you probably only started this thread for some attention 
If men were that aggressive we‚Äôd be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.
What the FRICK
What the hell
That has literally never happened.
I really hope you're joking
Heart breaking* sorry haha
Thank you, love. You too! ‚ù§ It's nice to find kindred spirits.
I‚Äôm so glad you had a lovely time! And you gave so many other people a good experience, too!
more like consistent*winner*, i hope you find a lasting happiness
They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
Dragon bender has even more negative value than [NAME] haha. But yeah, they‚Äôd need atlesst a 2nd for [NAME] crossover 
my brain hurts...
Polyamorous ain‚Äôt a sexual orientation hon
Who would have thought ! I'm glad he didn't shoot someone on his way down !
>For those of us who stay, there may be more unhappiness than happiness. Probably the saddest thing I ever heard. 
Ok but who‚Äôs gonna take one for the team and make their flair ‚Äúeats Xanax and moves on‚Äù
Infatuation and love and really different and I've found our the hard way, wait a couple weeks before using the big L word Nice tho :)
Aww how can you hate the little darling, it's so cute 
I told their kid that it was okay to be upset. (He was anxious and I was validating his feelings.)
Sorry thought you were the other guy that said it was a privilege.
Actually this is very clear thinking. This is the best answer on this thread. Thank you.
Wow. It looks really good!
Overall I'm 'gifted' but my processing speed is still below average
It's showtime!!
[NAME] is the greatest player to ever pick up a basketball
Of course he loves you! You‚Äôre his sugar momma. Seriously, ditch the bi*|‚Ç¨. You can and should do better. 
[NAME] isn‚Äôt interested in ceremony but is interested in having time with you. Love this!
Yeah, he knows about my mental health and how bad it cam get, we've tried all the things that have worked in the past 
In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.
No worries. Glad you like it
No wonder crime is going up if these morons are in charge.
R/sleeptrain Might be time for some sleep training. Take a look and try to feel out what's right for your family.
[NAME] bless you, fellow [NAME]! What a wonderful testimony of the changes that [NAME] can make in us. 
So cute! This lady thinks you're hot!
I hate having to take my shoes off!
What a sad end for this franchise. I doubt Fallout 5 will redeem it at this point... what a damn shame
Thank you xo
Carmichael is near the bottom? Find that hard to believe. [NAME] just under McDaniels? Words cannot accurately describe how inaccurate that is.
I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.
We are sorry but the sympathy you are looking for is not available in your region.
I love this! And I find myself thinking the exact same things. Soon...
That‚Äôs beyond disgusting in every way.
You dropped a ‚Äòwant‚Äô in that last sentence my dude
You're simply suggesting betrayal in a different form.
Wish you could choose to just have two bottles of the Pinot Grigio.
I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
We love you [NAME]
I found it really kind.
I had to buy all your music after seeing that vid. Amazing work.
Just read up on that guy, not sure he changed that much since his conversion unfortunately. 
Thanks man I‚Äôll try, you stay strong too!
also Appendix: i will explode whenever i feel like it to cause you pain
OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH ‚Ä¢jumps through window‚Ä¢
You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
Not at all. I wasn't offended in the least. Thanks for the promotion!
Welcome to my world. fml
Slightly too pissed off with this comment to merely downvote. Not angry enough to begin tirade. Lunchbreak ruined.
Lol too funny
Sydney is not for you
It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge.
Unfortunately no one usually fights for their rights without a martyr
Yes I have been getting my own therapy but this month was a wash for that because of work. Back at it next week.
Weird way to spell Voldo.
I'm impressed! After childbirth, I'm lucky to make it twelve minutes without having to pee...
My thoughts EXACTLY [NAME] looks dead.
I love your your moment, too many favs I but first that comes to mind is [NAME] finally suits up as [NAME] 
Since I was a kid I knew I preferred funny, smart, interesting girls to conventionally attractive ones. Really tore me up the feeling wasn't mutual.
The Republicans are worse though the NRA literally has to pressure Republican congressmen every time gun control gets brought up.
The restaurant business is pretty sleazy. There are a lot of affairs there.
And they could have kids... yeah sorry. I‚Äôm dumb
Much appreciated. It's something that has captivated my interest and I have written on a bit, so I have a reasonable working knowledge. 
Just relax and enjoy. We are gonna win by double figures as per usual.
That's so sad.
Her septum is crooked I'm hoping from the chain to her ear, but it's super irritating and I wanna snatch it out her face.
I know Bro! Won't happen again next Jan-uary.
Thank you for the correction. I'll make sure to be careful of that in the future.
Ya! It was a bangin‚Äô movie! A super fun ride with characters I cared about.
*sobbing* I love you bro, you always there for me *continues sobbing*
Old people sure do love their cable news history
I noticed this while watching it and cracked up... it was so cringey! It was after they watched their wedding montages.
Damn, he sold all out for that kick
except this isn‚Äôt true, we know this because other cities do the same thing and see no significant decrease in sales 
Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show. 
Could be worse, could be funky town
Some pretty dark shit man
It's amazing the advantage that you have when you advocate for the ruling oligarchs.
I forgot i followed this subreddit and now i'm having a meltdown
Man I hate that [NAME] guy.
[NAME] is gorgeous and so are you.
No. EDIT: Shoutout to the fat nerd who downvoted every comment in this thread just because we don‚Äôt stan the dancing games lmao
Her track record is pretty shaky
I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
The second overall pick is pretty embarrassing
Really? Hey mods, I have this pain in my lower back just about _here_.
[NAME] didn't want to win though. She got what she asked for
This sum GTA 5 type shit right here.
Outdoor cats have a lifespan of about 5 years so allowing them outside is basically a prolonged death sentence.
This was posted at the exact same time as another guy posted it on here, and that scares me.
LOL, I suppose so. All I'm saying is that... you can have a person and make them appealing too.
I hate text speak . Do you really want to dumb down your argument more than you need to?
I hope [NAME], [NAME], and that wonderful, talented, [NAME] QB defeat the Pats.
Those are liberal comments, you fucking idiot. Liberals are capitalists.
I lovee mazzy star sm, Flowers in December is my favorite song rn
I‚Äôm on it. Will be recruiting family and friends as well. Thank you üôèüèª
Interesting how [NAME] leads his team in BPM and RPM every year while not being the most important player. Defense and efficiency matters.
Had a baby before, those movements should be the last of your worries
Omg I'm so dumb I didn't even think of it like that.
It wasn't fair on the rest of the list, nothing is good as Tim Hortons.
Mad respect to her for being honest. I like how they consulted a dietician for their article to confirm a diet of cocaine and tapas was unhealthy lololololol.
I wish I could get a lazy Malinois. I love their look and Mal puppies are so cute! But I‚Äôm not a run-everyday dog owner.
That is a completely different point, and has nothing to do with nxt or its title being pointless. 
I‚Äôve never cringed so hard
Poor Target didn‚Äôt make enough millions during one of the most hectic Christmas seasons I recall in almost 2 decades. Gotta save that payroll though.
I love this man.
He's the only one who has managed anything positive in this game

Work like always, but grind that ironman on osrs in the meantime
Beautiful shots. Makes me want to finally take the jump into photography.

Wear you're ear pro kids. Styro plugs are cheap, and don't ruin the concert experience.... but it will save your ears.
No that's communism not socialism. There's a difference between them.
Yes! What the hell is it with ikea? My husband and I don‚Äôt go together anymore.
Streamgate works fine for me and i'm not even late :3.
Sorry for the bad formatting
Those women's marches are honestly embarrasing. Most of the people there only seem to claim to be a feminist because it's trendy.
Quit being a crybaby. If this how you handle any criticism then it's no wonder you're alone and will be for quite some time
Lol, thank you!
You look like a failed attempt to gene splice [NAME] and [NAME] DNA
Happy birthday [NAME] !
Ugh, [NAME]. Gross. 
nah. YOU will get it when you're about 20 years older.
And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!
I'm really interested in seeing those other 6
Worst president ever.
Ah, this may explain all the untimely heart attack deaths we hear about for those who opposed the state or whatnot 
I ain‚Äôt your pal buddy.
Well... this should get interesting.
I had a blast watching it and am glad you did too!
>@teamYouTube ok and thanks
I gotta say, some of the things mentioned are pretty fun. I mean, at least when your in your 20s. 
 cute, new driver still cares. Come back in 4 months and u will be showing pictures of that bag thrown on the trunk. 
it‚Äôs fantastic with reflex or holographic
Indication of questionable parenting perhaps. Encouraging this reaction seems a bit tacky. Not respectable, if we're truthful here.
Don't worry. You'll grow out of Pearl Jam.
> Books. Love them, have enough The library is your friend :)
Ngl the entire first order feels like a joke...
No problem here. Bio hardly ever matches the personality
Thank you.
I love all the cast in the later seasons, but the [NAME] relationship in seasons 2-4 are prime.
And dedmon is expiring. So he likely would have walked for nothing. Huge win
No clip? Screenshot? Picture at all? Sounds fake as hell
Thanks, didn‚Äôt know there was a term for it. That‚Äôs how I handled the first and last episode I saw lol
God [NAME] can't come back fast enough. I don't know if the fans in the rest of the league realize how big his loss is
That would be cool
Why thank you sir!
Nobody here says 'excuse me' , it's 'sorry' 
I love it (Blacklock holiday)
Excited for season 3 too. Winter is getting too cold
Thank you, I always try to keep professional (despite their lack of it). I will definitely do Glassdoor
A is just horrifying. If she were to die I‚Äôd want her to go painlessly
What's absurd here is that anyone believes a bottle of champagne is worth 34k.
It's this kind of fear that made me make this
Vancouver is such a beautiful city! I visited it for a half a day and really want to go back.
VP pick guaranteed - and the pivot will be hilarious
That lone pube you forgot to take off in the corner lol
Star Wars fans? Backlash? Nah.
The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It‚Äôs so condescending and creepy.
Thanks for the support
well there is something you cant say on this sub consider this strike 1
Great. How about go fuck yourself moron, I‚Äôm making a great suggestion for a good reason despite you bitches.
Sad if step kids are nice children I am sorry they are in this dynamic
Hi from a former [NAME]! Enjoy all the snow this weekend, we're barely getting anything in Iowa, which is frankly ridiculous. 
Players need to have Agency over their characters. you did not. total crap. :(
Can you fucking not
Your grad school advisor is an old fashioned idiot You are not. You are great!
Thanks dude. It‚Äôs honestly hard to distinguish because it‚Äôs felt like who I was for so long
I will, thank you! 
I don‚Äôt believe it is part of my credential program. I am going through the IMPACT Program of San Joaquin County Dep of Ed.
"I find that even when I wear a hat, I ""look [RELIGION]"" and get the same hate."
says the insecure idiot who just had to dig through my comment history to try to get back at me. lol creep
I am sorry but you have to accept your reality. Thare ain‚Äôt nobody here who can help you on this problem. Just call Î≥ëÎ¨¥Ï≤≠ ASAP
Great drawing :)
lol instead of getting blocked he deleted his account and called us all soulless and depraved.
I like that he keeps with the Cardinals‚Äô colors. This needs to be an alternative uniform
Excellent use of this scene. Your skills and taste border on wizardry.
Oh, okay. Thank you. I hadn't been keeping up with it.
I‚Äôd love a new Governor to do it. [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] are all talented orators.
I hope one of those staffers manages to find the tax returns [NAME] has been looking for since 2016!
For some reason, I thought this was one of his Bros trying to save him from her.
I didn‚Äôt rely on them necessarily. I just dislike chiefs and [NAME] lol
That's true deep voices are sexy.
I went to the theaters by myself just to go see it lol. I rewatched it last night too. If anybody needs a link, PM me!
And the human babies - don‚Äôt forget them! Totally wicked! Sad!
Whooo!! She waited... then paused the. Went in!! Oooooohhhh the shade!!!!!
Adorable little buggers.
I came here to laugh at memes. Not feel feels
Literally right after I sent it. What the hell
I'm so sorry, please stay strong and know you're loved 
very long very messy i usually have it in a bun to keep it under control lol
Oh, wow. Hope nothing happens to his arms on the way!
[NAME] was very athletic
Wow great analogy, exactly like that yes
That DJ Wilson Pass was a thing of beauty. So unselfish and skillfully done.
Dying like hero‚Äôs. What better way to die than saving the world. You‚Äôre right.
Oof, somebody doesn‚Äôt like anyone to make jokes or enjoy anything. It least we‚Äôre not complete pricks, douche.
Right, and the names would be different.
I never watched any [NAME] films, so. That. 
This is what happens when untrained people playing at being detectives and judges run into actual detectives and judges.
Nice little train journey. Come on everyone, shower up before the tour
The Birds is probably not quite what you are expecting.
... but he LOVES you. Perfect.
It‚Äôs because he so consistently lies and states mistruths. Why keep listening to a dishonest idiot?
Hopefully we will se [NAME] at least as a sub. We love you [NAME].
I think peach is hotter but not her attitude ha
American here. Not laughing. Routine circumcision of male infants is a violation of their bodily autonomy. I wish had my foreskin back.
Just woke up from one. Glad to know it's not just me. Hope you have a good return!
C-USA when it had [NAME] was pretty awesome.
Also available on Spotify and Apple Music. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated!
This really shows how young and ignorant most of them are.
I mean it doesn't say anything about comments? Anyways who cares it's a celebrity its his fault.
No I've been here for 5 years :( it's just gotten worse and worse
Get out. And take your facts with you.
Thanks for laugh, I needed that. 
Send your story over to r/nice guys, they'll love it 
"I think you missed a ""ba"""
At least I dont care about any of them.
They've done it before with private law and private militias, dumbass. 
Yep. Two actually. Both older. Brother undiagnosed, sister diagnosed. It‚Äôs been a hellish nightmare... 
"To the rest of the world, I would like to say, ""Sorry."""
So I've just read your whole post. Wow. Your mum is a piece of work.
This is why you play runescape as a kid, it teaches how to trust no one that offers free rune plate trimming
I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.
Oh we‚Äôre TANKING tanking
YES. I have been reporting this incel bottom feeding buttcoin troll for two days now.
Fascinating! Thanks for the info!
SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
If he was from a free pack he's not sellable, sorry
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs soup chef.
I can‚Äôt stand [NAME] but that was heartbreaking
Respect for the pedes
I'm sorry *what*
Poor baby :( I hope the snake is doing ok
[NAME] why would you blow your load on your fucking suit with fur on it
I should say to you that it's ok but at the cancer thing my mind changed Asshole, also get help
Just remember to refrigerate it and not leave it out.
Hey its me [NAME]
Stop using that excuse he hasn't been dominant since returning
"It's not ""over"". Don't believe that. Focus on making friends. The more people in your network, it seems better."
Nah they did a good job. It appears you‚Äôre very mentally unwell, I hope you get better.
I'd really like to see one of these red-striped zebras.
I'd understand if it was because of his conduct, but because of money? We're the Yankees, what the fuck man
Thank you for your service in the military and your attempted service in the patrol. [NAME] bless you.
He'd hate me. My standards are even higher.
Peace and love, my brother!
That man has such epic face
Oh dear.
RED ALERT RED ALERT
I don‚Äôt understand the point you‚Äôre making sorry
the trajectory of that is really weird! But [NAME], that guys arm, hand, possibly head is not liking the next .01 second!
Jajaja (hahaha)
How so? How do you keep stupid people from voting?
Sucking [NAME] pecker! They're no respect for your dignity! Suck it!!!!
[NAME] is often regarded as strategically the worst Lord in the series because of this. [NAME]
Wow crazy. Proud of her
Somehow this hurt more than the Saturday game.
Damn. [NAME]
OK sweaty, have fun in ur collapsing Union while I'm restoring the Empire xoxx
I‚Äôm sorry. It was nothing to be angry about
It‚Äôs so fucking creepy
Wow, now I am sad
Except [NAME] is worse
No it's not crazy , there are parts the we still don't understand but for the most part everything mades logical sense.
Serving us Ornacia!!! Honestly though I love this look!
Looks like the next level of a horror character
Yikes. That sounds terrible üò¢
hate to say it but nobody outside of saskatchewan has heard of [NAME] either
And religion isn't displayed on uber page. She saw a brown person and refused to interact with them solely based on race. She's a racist.
This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. 
I saw your missing post and hoped you found your baby! I'm sorry for your heartache
This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
It‚Äôs so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! 
Sex with men is hotter Maybe because society says it‚Äôs wrong
One day I created an email for doing online jobs. Then I stuck with the first half of the email address as my secret identity.
I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
We put Vaseline on our teeth and lips in theater so our lips wouldn't dry out or stick to our teeth from the lights lol
You're the reason [NAME] won the election. There isn't anything even remotely resembling fascism in the United States. Get a grip.
The irony that most of these disgusting things wouldn‚Äôt have made it through the winter without vaccines
Powerful stuff. I'm sorry I gave you this much time and credit.
My empathy to you.
I‚Äôm conflicted. I do in fact love wine, but I also love crown, and it would be more cost effective to bring crown. 
Some of us only play QP. I‚Äôd like to think QP is just as important as comp.
This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
Please don't ruin our self-deprecating-humor cope.
Sort of a joke, but there are many reasons. DW says engineer jokes are not funny.
I understand that they're meeting a demand I just don't think meeting that demand is a social good.
Yeah that last one made me hate her the most for some reason.
>Just be glad he didn‚Äôt kiss [NAME] mum. that'd make a good storyline tho tbh
I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
OP, this is the definition of manipulation. Ignore it, I promise it‚Äôll be better for you in the long run. 
>Downvote me, you cowards.
I hope G2 such a great org
I think, call before you come and limit it to an hour is reasonable if you have relatives that need to be told that. 
I mean it‚Äôs kind of weird that they miss that part we‚Äôre the Bible acknowledges other gods for selfish reasons
The Four Agreements is amazing and life changing. I don't keep that many books in my library, but this one has made the cut.
Nashville as a whole is easily one of the most classist, racist, judgemental, prejudiced cities I've set foot in. 
Your appearance doesn't magically look objectively creepy just because you're a creep. You're being stupid.
Thank you this is great, your post has helped as I was on the Mernda line about to get off at Clifton hill
Her parents are all for it, I made a good first impression and they're just happy that she is. Thanks :)
Unfortunately for me you have to be 23 or older to drive for TMC
Thanks now I want a subway!
Your username sort of checks out? Lol
I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I‚Äôm over him and his BS lol
Brah me and my fat family would of loved all that butter.
Thank you very much my good sir! If no one else has sent me a picture by then I'll make sure to inform you. Thanks again!
Crap, crap, mega crap!
I have nothing to offer you but my love.
Thanks a million, because I was very much thinking the opposite hahaha
Oh lord, we're about to have a hell of an offseason
lol [NAME] would definitely do this if [NAME] was that dumb to take this offer.
"""I'm a libertarian. I get attacked by both sides lol"" ""I voted [NAME] last election"" Uhhhh what"
But what did he druer? Sorry. (Im not sorry)
He did get 3 stars broüò≠
What absolute garbage
The fact that 34 thousand people upvoted that painting truly blows my mind
Great piece, thanks for sharing.
Hahaha, they are so lost
"I felt it once, then I quickly realised I was horribly mistaken when someone better came. There's no such a thing as ""the one"""
I need this in my veins now.
Don‚Äôt tell me what to do.
Same here, would love to help. Praying things get better for you and your family :)
I want [NAME] to bite me
I never said you did? I'm just going off the conspiracy that's been going around for awhile about her being a clone
It‚Äôs amazing what can happen when they get a good nights sleep
Yep first to go crying to the government but happy to bully single mums on the benefit
Only 22? Weak.
Who the hell thinks he isn‚Äôt overpaid
Yea. That video is garbage.
An extreme strawman example doesn't change what I said.
Being in a 3 person friend group fucking sucks sometimes m8 I feel like the least loved a lot of the time
You dont know how much that boosted my self-esteem right now. Thank you stranger
creepy, the only way to make it more creepy is to leave it on her bed stand table to find it in the morning. 
I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke
Wow you‚Äôre pathetic for calling out someone who did something right
Agree she doesn't deserve happiness since she has taken it from you!!
We did it [NAME], we stopped racism
[NAME] and [NAME]. Both are really cute in different ways
cuteee
He gets to watch boxing for free and get paid for it. It's probably his dream job. I'm happy for him! :)
Those women are the worst.
I‚Äôm getting visions of bitcoin private all over again. Good luck guys.
[NAME]
You just make her sound awesome.
I‚Äôm in the same boat with anthropology. 8 months post graduation. Still no job prospects. Glad I‚Äôm not alone
**GET OUT NORMIES! OUT!**
Logan Square also has the most rats (or reports of rats anyway)
It‚Äôs such a good show tho
Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
I love trying new foods for the most part
Oh, those dreadful things. I gave those away.
[NAME] ever love the busses
I couldn‚Äôt live like this. You should leave.
This would be boring as hell
>She was very normal LMAO This got me
Just legalize it, already. Do it the proper way instead of by executive fiat. I hate the lawlessness‚Äî‚Äúthe pen and a phone‚Äù bullshit.
hope he keeps his shit together, he can become great
I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.
[NAME] they need a union so badly.
I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation.
Bro he has always been a bully in the community. He is a pseudo scientist.
It's a miracle! This is how religions start.
I already know what they're dealing with, i just cant help without hurting them emotionally or lying to them
Yeah, right.
Good news. Makes me feel BCH is way underpriced and has a huge upside.
It makes us more determined to tank for Zion
I will try that! I have never really tried balancing exercises but will give that a try too! Thank you.
Better yet, get rid of them if they are non-essential. Why are my tax dollars paying for worthless jobs?
roll a blunt, walk over and strike a conversation.... or mind your fcking business
This makes me unfathomably angry.
I first liked [NAME], but disliked her after [NAME].
Theres the link I use you stupid fuck get the fuck off my post you fucking shill
Hey, can you post a pic (or many) of the chow/corgi mix? I really need to see it. Thanks. Actually, the kittens too. 
is it bad that i agree with this
Thank you for that. My gf jumped right next to me! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals
Sorry but what map is Adlersbrunn? Edit: Ah nevermind I see (after zooming in, it is the [NAME] map)
I'm glad I decided to watch this. Intense, entertaining football with an expert demonstration of how-not-to-use-VAR thrown in for free.
it‚Äôs starting to get weird
It's too small of a traffic circle to make sense
Brain dead clearance. Honestly deserved lead. They have been better.
the hate we get in here is palpable.
s p o o k y
Because it's the one right that we hope to never need, at least in the sense of revolt or self defense.
And I'm loving it. It's driving the chuds mad.
Congrats! How are you feeling about it?
Good for #70 to console the poor guy
We aren't a bunch of Republican puppets like you believe.
Don't do that i think its dangerous
Ashamed of being British
I‚Äôm sorry. Your city blows.
Lots of hugs, kiddo ! They ***are*** heifers !
Here's a great essay by [NAME] regarding the Skripal farce that I've just run across:
I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my Brother a few years back. My thoughts and heart is with you.
This shit ain't rocket science GateKeeper
Sad but exciting to see him in a place where he might perform well. Hopefully he stays injury free.
Your 17. End of conversation. You don‚Äôt love him
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
Hopefully they realize that anti-discrimination law is immoral and unconstitutional.
Awesome! Congratulations. That is a nice investment.
Self confidence I think and the fact that I‚Äôm scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won‚Äôt reciprocate.
I would have to imagine this girl has just been training super hard for the past few weeks.
Lol! Taxes are where the soul goes to die. Good luck, man! Get that degree and run far away!
It's become extraordinary, quite.
It's just nonsense. Any truly responsible gun owner respects life more than being tough.
They very clearly state no new accounts can post. Yours is 2 weeks old and low karma.
I didn't like this, not for even one second. 
Shotgun Stories (2007) doesn't have the bank robbery hook, but is about two families feuding in rural Arkansas. [NAME] is great in it.
You could have the sweetest peach in the world, and there is always someone who just doesn't like peaches.
I see Barca fans saying [NAME] is better and I can't help but laugh.
- But mom! I don‚Äôt wanna go to school today! - You‚Äôre going little shit.
Oh nice I have that one
Might as well try though! Have a good day bro!
no no no you don‚Äôt understand! personal responsibility means nothing! it‚Äôs all [NAME] fault! /s
Yep.... Have fun
- me when I‚Äôm definitely not fine but too embarrassed to admit it
The TV anime series is, at least, atrociously bad and stupid. Is full of deus ex and silly cliffhangers.
Ooh! Ooh! I want to lose more than 5-10 vanity pounds! (...wink wink)
wat u fecker
It's normal school except they sexually identify as [RELIGION]
This is the most fucking sensible comment I have seen in the this subbredit. Have the exact same opinion.
I don't think you can afford a lawyer. If fact, I would not be surprised to learn you don't actually have anything on QCX.
Just added that information. Thanks
I miss the [NAME] and [NAME] love story.
Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
My fav frank songs are white Ferrari, super rich kids and bad religion, I know those are popular songs I just wanna get deeper into his music 
Like [NAME] Dad who was replaced after only 1 appearance, [NAME]
Their numbers seem large because they get so much publicity. But I suspect that even most young people find that ludicrous.
I think she's funny lol. She'd have a better chance at a comedy career than modeling.
Not anymore, haven't heard of him in ages.
sorry, i phrased that wrong. i meant that as a asexual, i get that a lot
I guess your ex-fiance was different huh? That's really interesting. I've never had a fiance before, personally
Isn't the swastika backwards? I just love how fucking stupid racists are Can't even draw their own shit right
I really wanted this to be a real sub.
FYI: Time in Europe works the same as in the State. We do not have 'weird time'
It's very common. Same with punching and it not hurting someone in your dreams. Practice more.
If your friend ever decides to go public with their content, make sure to let us know. We're more than happy to promote them. 
I'm so afraid to weigh myself. I'm gonna have to do it soon though üò≠
"If she is sorry at all. Could be more along the lines of ""I am pretending to be sorry so I don't get fired."""
Lmao that's a funny coincidence
I can when enough time has passed. I've got each of their playoff games from that year and it's fun to relive it during the offseason.
I'm not going to Photoshop that even as a joke because I know someone will find it out of context and take it seriously.
I get migraines too and I‚Äôm sooo tired the first two days of my period
That sub bans and deletes anything that's not flattering to [NAME]. Don't expect anything other than ideology and cult behavior from those idiots.
Keep your head straight, stay on your path, and stick to your guns. 
Don't make me talk about [NAME]... ...
Overhead fans are absolute shit. They literally do nothing but blow dust around.
Funny, but why do I care what his name is?
I hate that I like them...
I am glad your okay.
There is no excess. Everybody gets what they agreed upon. Fake news.
Wow you‚Äôre mom is truly living by the love first motto that is [RELIGION].
"If you have to ask ""how to know if I'm ready for psychedelics"" then you are clearly not ready."
I'll admit. I wanted to be upset because I don't identify as a feminist, but also that dress is super cute omg you are very talented
[NAME] was their best player
>you never learn anything ever from university This is not true
Probably overdose in a hotel after losing my virginity to an escort on my 30th birthday
I like you
The first half is able to run on the momentum of being stupid fun, the second half falls apart really quick.
It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.
It‚Äôs really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
Do hope you're going to let that poor, traumatised boyfriend know. Sounds like he's had more than enough abuse already
I honestly do not know. Chastise them for their hardness of heart and presumptiveness I suppose. I guess that is what [NAME] would do.
Amusing considering she isn‚Äôt a mom.
Reality: someone sees a pet outside and thinks it doesn't have a home, so they adopt it.
Totally forgot that, my bad
Fuckin Finnish spitz out there bud
Truth never changes. Maybe it's questionable to you, but... 
It tore off lol. The bracket isn‚Äôt installed on delivery.
Winnipeg Jets regularly have whiteouts, though I don't believe anyone paints themselves.
Having sex with a child in the room is often difficult and boring.
you‚Äôre acting mad pretentious lol there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to live in Cali
To me he's extremely funny. Love him.
I've been pinched a couple times by it's tiny brothers, would not recommend holding that! Damn! It's cute tho. 
i feel we can all relate
FUCK YOU CHAD, WE ARE COOL GAMERS RISE UPüòéüòéüòéüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüî•üî•üëÖ BOTTOM TEXT 
My hope is gone, too. Sounds like we've both tried over, and over, and over again. When do the realisations hit you?
I love the fact that [NAME] kept the nose thing for so long he had a mark for the rest of the episode
Do you have the MVP Giambi card? The stats are nice vs [NAME] but he hasn‚Äôt really performed like I expected
This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
She doesn‚Äôt even like dog fetus, how picky of her
I just wanna stick my hand in it and grab handfuls and stir it all around lol
The same comedy bit [NAME] has disavowed because it's used almost exclusively in circumstances like this? It's an awful and weak explantation.
Wow did we marry the same guy. My STBX left the state for 3 months with no contact with his child.
They‚Äôre as good as tagged
All good... I work alone. Thanks for the info!
I'll miss [NAME]
Buddy... Are you ok? Is there a teacher at your school that's strange? Kidding. Nice post as always.
Society has once again falsely made men look cold and emotionless. You're normal.
I really need to stop taking my guns fishing with me. I keep losing them!!! :(
looking forward to your selfie saturday then
Should of just stabbed her up tbh why let someone steal from you
Right before that he called [NAME] for getting barged in the back and nearly kicked in the face. Weird performance. Didn't change the result mind
Yeah I think I'll just push her away, thank you.
This is embarrassing, but while purging I wear a pad or don‚Äôt wear pants at all. Eating disorders are so beautiful /s
fuck these dysfunctional, insecure mattresses
sorry mr brolobo
He looks pretty fresh in most everything. Yes homo.
This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder
Thanks for saying that, it wasn't easy ... definitely sparked a long period of discussion and reflection!
I love doxies. They're absolutely the best most pain in the ass wonderful loyal dogs.
Sorry guys, accidentally sold 10,000k
The kid you're replying too is a known [NAME] stan lol, he's gonna argue with any narrative that [NAME] is close to [NAME].
Because you're not making one in any coherent way. As such, I'm done. 
Yup. That doesn't contradict what I said- this isn't a derailing conversation that I was starting.
I want a sense of progression and accomplishment in overwatch, something golden guns and skins dont give me anymore :)
Now all we need is to beat them in the playoffs one last time and win the super bowl THEN I'll be able to be happy
I‚Äôd rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot
I'm N-word, and I miss my dad
As it should be. No way I'd want my kid crossing 5 lanes of traffic to get to the bus everyday.
Cute and acts like a puppy but sexy at the same time. Totally exists btw
lol, suit yourself.
this is so sad Alexa play despacito
Such a shame. Her butt was pert, cute and perfect in her Vogue days. Yes, I am showing my age.
It's like an instinct for idiots to downvote without even reading a comment first if they sense the word vegan in it haha
"You can buy the full ""girlfriend experience"" with a hooker for way less than 13k lmao."
Sad/Sweet for her to put in the effort to fake it!
Wish the blasters were more like BF1
Well this is terrifying.
I, personally, am excited to have another agent to make the lab numbers look pretty while the patient dies. 
you are trying to use post-modern mumbo jumbo deconstruction of words. Go away, idiot.
I'm sure you're alright, [NAME]. xD
You're back but you're still broken.
I feel like people kind of just... forgot about it, somehow? I watched the whole thing and it was a really really fun one
It's going to hit all of us but there it is : no deal. It's high time to accept reality.
[NAME] is giving y'all some weird energy. I wish [NAME] would do that
Poor *wittle* snowflake feels harassed, hahaha. If you don't want people to prove you're a moron, maybe don't make it so obvious.
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
Wow this was an eye-opening response, and you‚Äôre right it helped us learn more, be compassionate and focus on a better well-being.
Wow. No words. America, the land of opportunity!!!!!
My class size until 5th grade was 6 students...wish I had more classmates back then.
I wish this was on Betfair, I'd quite enjoy making some money from Remainers.
Hey.... that's not the wallet inspector...
I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times...
Yep. It's pretty bad having to use work or a paid email and real name on a gaming forum.
I have a Secrets engagement ring, I love it, cost 1/10th of a real diamond and no one can tell. Would highly recommend!
"""I don't socialize because i'm unhappy and i'm unhappy because I don't socialize"". -Socially anxious bastard"
They will. The White House gave credit yeste day to Russia and Syria and saod they will finish the fight against ISIL.
At least it's decent pay. Lol.
You can't simply shut a baby up, lol
Ya uh that's gen Z sorry
This is great and Elephant is pretty fun. We went to the clown exhibit last month.
I freakin‚Äô love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!
I‚Äôm interested in the tactics and positional play lmao ;)
I'm a guy and it's the same for me! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. üòä
Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?
I've got my sticker peeled off, nasty desperate notes left on the windshield, driver door..
Stupid pipe ruined a pretty good debut
What a garbage post
I'd hardly call them innocent if they're reveling in the thought of more mass shootings. People like that deserve worse, quite frankly.
My balls shrunk up looking at that
You might be able to google earth it? I dont know that area very well so I cant help at all. But thats what I would try.
That was 1 scene and I think was more about her sense of powerlessness in the situation
I agree a million percent. People on this sub are way too emotional about ghosting in early stage dating.
Iirc congressional opposition was the main obstacle for closing gitmo. I could be misremembering but that's what I remember
Python2 end of life will be nice, though.
100% communication with an NT is awesome!
That's such a selfish mentality to have.
My heart skipped a beat when I saw this. My childhood dog looks just like them, and her name was Brandy!
I've been a huge fan of them since the early days was wondering about this for so long! Glad they explained it/are alright now!
Photo critique? It's quite blurry. But the colours is great, as is the angle. 
This is fantastic! What an incredible gesture. Given the current fears British [NAME] are currently living under, this is a very welcome bit of news.
I‚Äôm glad things are coming to light, I pray justice is served for the victims. 
We, the fans, are the losers here.
Good luck mate!
""" [NAME] has come down with a terrible sickness which caused him to deactivate his twitter account"" Jeez sicknesses these days get worse and worse. "
No one loves you. Cry more.
I‚Äôm tired of these stupid posts. Stop trying to become a meme. You‚Äôre ruining this sub!
You‚Äôll love r/2healthbars
My fault, I jumped to a conclusion. I forgot that savanna cats are spotted not leopard print.
You‚Äôre right, republicans are worse because they have nukes.
Youve missed everything.
you have zero evidence that anything in this story is fabricated. your blind cop hatred just really, really wants you to believe that.
Still not as bad as [NAME] not being able to figure out how to push a god damn button.
You are saying toxic people try to be the victim by calling you toxic.
Oh, that's horrible. My condolences.
TRENDY PEOPLE DANCING WITH PRODUCTS
My withdrawal was marked as complete. Likely doesn't matter now though with the servers being completely offline.
You've been able to survive going in between tracks on multiple games in the franchise. I've always done it lol
Ah thank you! I just remembered it the way I said. Was never sure if that's what it meant.
NO GOD NOOOO!
i already gave away too much of the secret it's relevant save yourself before its too late
Well that‚Äôs horrific
Don't let your high expectations of government disappoint you.
Her accent!! I died.
Lemon cookies are the best
He was afraid of flying
Sometimes it‚Äôs annoying but I think it‚Äôs at an okay place right now
It‚Äôs because their pay sucks. You get what you pay for! Edit: grammar MoFo!
He's the only dignified politician, but it's still bizarre that people can be so enamoured of a literal [NAME]
Stay strong. You've come this far. Keep going.
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.
> I'm sure there are plenty of us who have been through it to. Seconded.
But still incorrect usage of that subreddit. Shame! Shame!
they have died here in canada
Also the people there would love our scarlet and gold colors (I'm Chinese).
I love you [NAME], you is my only friend.
Pant full of turd.
If my dog were as ugly as you, id shave its butt, and tell it to walk backwards
You quack!
I wish I could be as cute as that :c
Nope, they still left even though they knew I was going through a rough patch :)
WHY THE FUCK IS WES ON THE FLOOR, HE CANT DEFEND SHIT
Yum!!! I love almond milk!! ü§ó
I love this üòÇ
Well I will get to your disagreements. However you maybe the last FIFO worker that exists in Alberta, however, don't take it for granted. 
my heart melted omg [NAME]
It's so satisfying. It's the little things that makes pubg the best!
Thank you so much for your kind words, I didn‚Äôt think anyone would take the effort. 
[NAME] did a photo shoot with the first presidency. Hilarious
That didn't go the way I thought it would
You look awesome in this picture
Sorry this is the first time I saw it, I‚Äôll delete it.
> and the top 20% of wealthiest [NAME] own 92% of stock Well, I hope they had a wonderful December, then.
Haha sorry I‚Äôm still pretty clueless about this app
It's embarrassing!
Self driving cars still won't help fix the problem if old people can't afford them
Ah man great memories .. campaigns were soo memorable
Too much sympathy in this thread for a creep who didn't get consent first. I'm glad he got humiliated on tv.
Add to that the balance mess.
and I love him for that
This game is so good, nearly every dc character you can think of is in it
This is so true.
Fucking [NAME] with lazy passes all night long
Then much of the advice here is terrible because it congratulates him on doing the entirely wrong thing.
Beak makes no sense. Well beaks make no sense anyway but this one especially
I don‚Äôt even try to make shots like this myself. So I gotta watch other people make them.
Ooohh... [NAME] wouldn't like that!!
To bad your mother didn‚Äôt swallow your dumbass
Exactly, if I recall right, the last tall forward in barca was [NAME] no?
Glad to see Hearts fans giving [NAME] such a warm welcome back..
Dont see why she is attractive, she looks like a chihuahua with watermelons on her chest.
Well done. I like it!!
This hurts me
r/puns might appreciate this. I know I did!
What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
Just be glad you‚Äôre not his wife
[NAME] speed RL üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sure you are, comrade. You've met your quota of replies now, yes?
I would love if a double amputee walked in and have watched as they decline the poor fellar service
You sound upset.
Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters
I was hoping they both were gonna hit the ground lol
Take your upvote, you no good bastard.
Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back.
Oh no this is cute
> Nothing mentioned about him thinking to transfer. That's what this whole thread is about, dork.
Funny that you name her when shes one of the only judges that uses her brain and ethics to make decisions.
I mean she‚Äôs barely into college so she‚Äôs only maybe 18-20 but to be this oblivious is pretty sad.
Don‚Äôt worry, we can be crucified together üôåüèø
Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
So you lucky you won as you work illegal teach. Glad you leave.
you should be super proud of yourself. super, super proud. you are absolutely strong, brave and above all AWESOME!! 
yep. And there are jobs I still would want done, they just shouldn't be government
I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
It most definitely is! You‚Äôve gotta pick some up!!
Looks extra creepy in light of the recent revelations about his campaign.
Stop trying and just do it. Then decide if it‚Äôs worth the effort. Otherwise this is just envy.
While I agree, that doesn't necessarily means we should take those 3 in the first 3 rounds. It really depends on the players available. 
Replacing pillows often is also important. Buy more less expensive pillows. I love pillows from Ikea.
I was love bombed, then ghosted... and it broke me
Very disappointed to find out that you can‚Äôt play NCAA football on PS4. Wack.
you got me [NAME]
Love that he obviously went out there to do weird sweeping strokes in the snow. Those look super effective
Phoenix sunrises and sunsets have been nice the past week with all the clouds and rain - beautiful shot!
You forgot >Having a $1500 debt on LES due to Finance fucking up
Good [NAME] she needs to stop
Yeah I agree, it really is interesting. I guess that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many different medications out there lol.
If you know anything about those sources then either you understand the dismissal or we aren't going to agree.
Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
What a disgusting person she is
Came here to say this. I thank you kindly. Long live America. üòÅ
That's not how it works
Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
Best pen in baseball, even though I'd still take [NAME] over [NAME].
To be fair he did apologize for that one after he learned what Pride was really about but I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend going near his Twitter anymore
No, there‚Äôs a ton of people like you in this thread who don‚Äôt seem to understand that head glitching does not equal taking cover.
Thanks I love him
This is a huge stretch, but I would enjoy seeing some tweets from her hubby about it...
If I died I've always wondered who will be at my funeral. I imagine only my mom. Maybe one of these days I'll find out.
Just cleared normal mode! I'm having a lot of fun xD
Shame the 'all in' doesn't apply to managers. He has hired some duff managers over the years.
I think [NAME] is starting to get too much blame, everybody on the roster sucks with the exception of [NAME] 
They don't want equal rights. They want extra rights.
Thanks nate. If you need any help any time or support I'm here for ya.
[NAME] damn it, I knew something was wrong, oh well.
Definitely the second to be frank. I just wanna get the best deal I can on a car I‚Äôm pretty in love with.
Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital has these!!! Love it!
Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny
Sorry man. I didn‚Äôt know you were on reddit. Didn‚Äôt mean to steal your stuff! I totally would have tagged you
Realize that no girl is perfect for you if you're not perfect for her. I feel for your disappointment tho. Keep on truckin'.
it's horrid :/
None of the movies deserve it and honestly the oscars are a sham at this point.
Happy cake day!
He doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs terrified, cries and hugs you. Basically one of the scariest scenes in TWD.
Burn wait someone already did it sorry
‚ÄúPeople said I was stupid for stretching out my lobe so far that it ripped. Well who‚Äôs stupid NOW?‚Äù
It's practically non existent. Im mostly afraid to initiate a hug because I'm afraid I don't know/forgot how to hug.
As high as ~72% in black families. Truly heartbreaking what the expansion of the welfare state has done to the black family.
yo STOP going on your roof on dxm man you don't want to fall and hurt yourself
old ladies are so wholesome
I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
Unfortunately, we live in 21st century America, where this kind of behavior ensures that they will both be given high-paying jobs at CNN.
Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
Yes I would love to see!
Hahaha ;)
Happy Birthday!! It was great seeing her at the Royal Rumble and SmackDown.
At this point I am questioning your sanity, you compare a guy with 40/34 goal seasons to a kid who literally can't hit the net
Thanks :).. My issue got solved :) . YT on Twitter never helps.. they just do the basic troubleshooting.
He's the only legitimate jetpacker
Saw this yesterday and it's way funnier with the whole joke spoiled by the /r/bestof title, for sure. 
Yes. He‚Äôs a much better option than [NAME]
This isn't really wholesome
Love their channel, with tracks like these I'm expecting them to become a full band
I wish I could make a garden
Damn. Low tech bait bike
Thank you for your service
Any time [NAME] is brought up is a good time for this:
FUCK YESSSSS CJJJJJJJJ
What‚Äôs all this meow?
I believe this is called Darwinism - the suicide by Tide pods anyways. The murder part with the blindfolds is just tragic.
This is so sad. #playdespacito
 a thing, and I‚Äôve had my share of Whistle Pig Pie. I hate me 
oh i wish i didn't read that, [NAME]
*Rosa..Rosa..Rooosaa, Yeah! Beautiful Rosaa*
That song was epic live
I am sorry for making fun of your username, I sincerely apologize.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Oh my god.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
"""[NAME] could drown in a glass of water."" LOL. i actually love [NAME], though. i know i'm in the minority."
I dunno, I love me some barrel-aged spirits and ales.
Lol... that is awesome.
And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.
Lake inle is a beautiful place
Also, he never gets hurt so you can't Robidas the guy. 
I'm crying right now, I don't know why. Doesn't even make me feel anything. 
Can [NAME] just shut up and appreciate her dog?
I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD
"""While we've decided not to hire you for this postion mr. [NAME], we have an opening at the ticket window"""
"Well, actually it is a joke on how mansplainers often start their mansplaining with: ""well, actually""."
What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.
"Exactly what I was thinking. ""Oh, I'm sorry, let me just undo that for you then"""
Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn‚Äôt washed the blood out yet.
So now it‚Äôs a habit to live in a country without a running government I guess!
How is this cable beneficial to Belgium? Who agreed to this?
good guy kawhi
Being misunderstood really is the worst thing ever! I‚Äôm sorry some people are so unkind.
Of all of the fan-favorites from each city, [NAME] being the fan-favorite confuses and annoys me most. Her headlines are becoming insufferable.
Best kiki dance I‚Äôve ever seen
I will dude. Have a good one
Fucking Instagram normies
If you wanna spend thousands for every piece of furniture then sure but a lot of people don‚Äôt have the budget for this.
oddly enough, i really like it
sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
Agreed. Everything she did was bad. She didn't anything good at all. Edit: Grammar.
Aah I hope he's okay. So glad it's back! Time to get creeped out tonight.
I wish [NAME] son was older so it be possible he did this.
BITCOIN SEND MONEY INSTANTLY (waits 6 months to get money and still praises site)
At last, someone I can share this accomplishment with! 
He‚Äôs better than [NAME].
Hahaha damn.
This sounds like a toxic relationship for the both of you. Seems miserable... I‚Äôd hate to be in that relationship
Pull that sucker right up to your face
This is awful.
I thought I was the only one who loved cold pizza! Everyone thinks I‚Äôm crazy! I‚Äôd rather have cold pizza than hot honestly
I grew up in the upper peninsula of Michigan so I love the ShopKo reference because those stores are usually in places with depressed economies.
No you shouldn‚Äôt. If you recieve income, it should be taxed.
This is an incredible insight I've never thought of before. loyalty vs disloyalty, compared to care vs harm, I mean.
Sooooo happy for you.
[NAME] is my top choice. Love the tape and could anchor the line for many years
I feel you, names are the worst. 
Dude, I'll be your friend any time. Especially if you got Steam/discord. I will link u to our friend group's server.
They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me.
[RELIGION] is what produces these people, there are plenty of them and a beheading has even occured in the streets of LONDON.
This is hilarious
you might be more of an optimist than me. hopefully you're right
And everybody clapped! Fuck this loser!
It was so frustrating seeing him overthrow people every week. I hope he makes that a point of focus this off-season.
Yeah, the big thing I'm glad is he hasn't ballooned up. 
> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements.
I actually liked them. I love the idea of Conqueror being a rabid and maniac dog.
I highly doubt they would do that in CA. That would put prices at 36$/pack and no one is going to pay 9$/pod.
Just an employee, just stressed that it takes so long to save 10k for example and even that is nothing ! Should of brought more bitcoins
Are you seriously this dumb?
There was no Israel then dumbass!
You're right! I linked the wrong one. Thank
Oh ya, that‚Äôs [NAME]!
[NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you
You sound like my gf. I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
Its ok we all know you suck scrub.
[NAME] is a madman and I love it.
It pays well and I enjoy it. I travel 6 months a year. For the last 16 years.
I‚Äôm a baptist and I laughed at this statement, have a nice day funny boi.
You're an uneducated twat.
I think this is next on our list, thanks!
Ah, thank you
Condiments suck. Mostly because I love them so much. Why cant they just be free calories?!?!
I um like your username
Hmmm.. this is kind of interesting that our name was even thrown into this mix.
Poor Guy. Come back stronger than ever!
"I'm finding it hard to distinguish ""discuss the merits of conspiracy theories"" and ""debating"" those theories."
You're right to be nervous. That happened near my college's campus when I was a student. She lost everything in her wallet.
I think I might like a front end web developer job but not positive since I've always been in healthcare/science
I think we still have a decent shot at the playoffs because the hornets are also really bad but I would rather miss it and tank tbh
Also, popcorn can't build ladders. At least, I don't think so...
They're not going to read their UserVoice anyways. It's a PR stunt.
Its the easiest subject in the whole school, they teach us stuff we should‚Äôve learned when we were 11, it‚Äôs so bad...
Wait, apple and [NAME]? Please tell me these fools are all on windows phones 
Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
Yes, it's Harbinger, and you can get it in the Cosmic Chest.
*All I want is to be left alone* *In my average home* *But why do I always feel* *Like I'm in the Twilight Zone?*
[NAME] royally fucked up that last rotation. Also did [NAME] even get a single kill with their specialists ?
Rules say no identifying information
SKYRIM!! Hahaha
Love the Cafe Zoetrope, such a charming place. Beautiful building too.
üò≠üò≠ okay. You‚Äôre right! I should just like make ice cream at home and get over it.
I knoooow like why do people exist just to make things worse I‚Äôm so tired of all these alts/ weird question askers
I don't care, [NAME] tweets make me uncomfortable and I hate him!!! - Liberals
"He gets criticized for being too ""showy"" in his dialogue because people dont actually talk like he writes. But I love it"
I come up and hug her and say good morning, usually joke around about the dog or something. Nothing negative really
Qwertyuiop makes for a great snack though
That moment when you feel isolated in r/ForeverAlone. Never had anyone like me
aw momma big hugs.
you sound pretty TRIGGERED bro hahaha
You know what‚Äôs ignorant? People who spend their free time making themselves look like a belligerent, disputatious assholes. Find something better to do. 
You‚Äôre the best grandmother a person could hope to have.
Yeah I had android and was having difficulties but I was able to get it easily when using my gf's mac. Thanks!
I love them, it's so fun to jump around everywhere
Well, we did win the only Ghosts tournament we played together. I think 7/8 with the 1 being a 2nd has to at least be considered.
Thats insane. Someone died like 2 years ago after a bolt got kicked up by a truck and went through his windshield and hit him on 146 in LaPorte
Oh good I‚Äôm not the only one. Hello my people.
Assuming it is manufacturer defect, sure. A lot of times, it comes down to the owner not properly caring for their gun.
It says new, but I feel like they should call it 'used.'
[NAME] was the 4th best RB in the game, behind [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]
AND THEY ARE REALLY ANNOYING WE MADE FIRST CONTACT 30 YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL SENDING US TERRIBLE MINION MEMES
Not funny....
>This game is dying because toxic people like you ruin it. Speak for yourself
I dont even try to land it, half the time if I am flying low a building or the ground will suck me up and destroy the plane
I think only Germany would have this kind of organization skills. Source: Know 2 Germans. Am therefore expert.
Are you saying that's why they went with [NAME]? That's racist
not really. I worked hard to live there, and it was different then. Far cheaper. 
Thanks for the explanation! And lol yeah that‚Äôs fair - ‚Äòrag‚Äô isn‚Äôt exactly the flashiest of terms!
Oh yah for sure, I am on that page dude. I thought that‚Äôs what you meant.
What. The. Fuck.
Dont worry about the other people. Driving is filled with way too many other anxieties to have worries about dropping a deuce in a truckstop bathroom.
Yup. Was so annoyed to see this making the rounds yesterday.
Haha good theory but not the case. I'm completely aware of when I'm intoxicated or not.
I dont think a murder log that survived what killed off trex counts as cute, even if its only 2 or 3m long. 
No, of course, no one has ever had his best axedwarve decapitated in the first goblin fight.
Always a pleasure to have our board of directors pay us a little visit.
Don't go pushing your shame on others. I pull my weight my dude.
Block him and stop replying to his comments. Not worth it.
It's crazy I don't get where their finding them
I LOVE this.
Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.
That would really piss them off
I hate to be that guy, but there are 6‚Äô0‚Äù + women
Yeah I've noticed that. I probably give off Aspie traits to NTs but Aspie like traits bug me
[NAME] forbid i love and support and show that support and love for my country apparently im racist now...
If I say 6:45 they tell me at 8:00 that they‚Äôre not coming :(
aww hell no. This fucking ad
I chopped it up a little for you. I hope that helps. I'm not sure I can make that much more concise.
Fitter faster stronger better
I've learned everyone in this video is an idiot
Anarcho-capitalism is indeed a joke, yes
Fam, I fucking love [NAME] play. Gotta be the most exciting dude in the league other than [NAME] when he‚Äôs hitting everything from 30ft+
The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree
"The sound ISN'T mixed terribly like in high school kids and a nice taxidermised bear in the USA, a beautiful day!""."
That poor kid. That is going to cause some issues for them as well down the road.
Entire new coaching philosophy is needed. Enough wasted possessions, contested iso mid-range jumpers with 15 seconds left on the shot clock and terrible 3pt defense.
Seeing something as beautiful as this just made my day today! Thanks for sharing :)
I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. üíî
Those are horrible things to say to a child, let alone a 3 yr old. I would be pissed!
Thank [NAME] can we need more guys healthy
There are no words to help heal your broken heart, but I‚Äôm sending you as much love and support I can. 
CIA?... Yes, this one right here.
I actually watched this entire debate just now. Holy shit. [NAME] is a legend. [NAME] would be proud.
A complete lack of self-reflection is a prerequisite for being a [NAME] supporter.
Different doctors have different opinions on who should and shouldn‚Äôt be vaccinated.
This is simply beautiful <3 thank you for sharing this, it touched my heart to hear such a wonderful success story <3
Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
Much appreciated! I'll surely come back and let everyone know what I find!
Kids are awesome
>recommending Elite mode to first time players My stomach turns in disgust
I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street.
Nah, I‚Äôm good, just trying to help you out. Have a good one
"[NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king. "
"I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs and yet still am not ""happy rich and all that people say this brings"""
Thats about how 10% of the US population are lol
This guy should go to HELL
I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked.
That‚Äôs one pissed off [NAME]
This made me laugh, have an upvote good sir 
My one regret is not making an account sooner. I lurked for a long time because I felt like I didn't have anything worth saying.
thank you!
Even if I close the app, mine still pings.. It's maddening
Thanks for clarifying!
:( disappointed, i expected to give out personal therapy cats.
That was an old-fashioned Good old hockey brawl! What a fight! [NAME] definitely got the best of him though!
Just sitting in the fast lane fishing for tickets. Ugh.
And he‚Äôs been with same org with his former teammates before Vegas. That and highly doubt [NAME] would drop a loyal player.
I just wish she could do this on the show more readily
The adults are a bit drunk and I just got called an anti social bastard Pray 4 me
You look like a guy that could use help pleasing his wife.
Just don't bring up the Manga Carta. Really uncomfortable for my history class.
I worry about throwing draft picks around, but a guy like that is worth it IMO.
Shut up you shill /s
This is the saddest thing I've seen today
Id like to see Finland win it. But id like to see [NAME] and [NAME] carry their teams in every way possible to those losses.
WOW I love this photo so much! Is this recent?
I was guessing because you can use the HVAC in a Prius without running the engine. They're good vehicles to live in for that reason
Welp, I'm an idiot. Even better on you for going through the trouble to give credit, then.
Wow! I've never heard of a celebrity doing something so nice
It's the lists fault!
I‚Äôm going to say it. Those films are mostly over rated. Boring same old tame CGI stuff every time.
It usually comes out after people catch me dissociating.
Goose don‚Äôt give a fuck
You are right OP didnt think this 1 through
I tried to send this to a friend but [NAME] knocked it away.
That was painful.
Hmmmmm. I'll have to go pay that sub a visit.
Damn straight.
It looks really pretty :D!
[NAME] IS SO HAPPY AND SO AM I!! Edit: [NAME] I see you, relax
It was worth mentioning anyways, the Packers are a special kind of awful.
Maybe but their fish tacos are really good.
The fact that you think like this is terrifying.
Im done talking to you because i can expect better response from a wall. Feel bad for you. I hope it isnt too cold in your moms basement
At least [NAME] got to touch UFC gold. Not many people can say the same. In good company.
i dont think you guys understand it at all tbh.
Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
Klokslag 12 I find really enjoyable, horror movie podcast, Im not a horror fan but I find these dudes very entertaining
It's great, though kind of painful if you ever had dreams of writting/drawing/making a comic/game/novel it hurts a lot.
You know how I know Boomers are trash? They love [NAME].
Stop spreading false hope!
I'm so sorry
Hey man, if you need the Chiefs to lose to bring you any sort of pleasure I get it. But at least be classy about it! 
The acl is somewhere inside yes. Some people also said it was a lateral ligament. Hope he can recover quickly.
Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
Memes are going to get fucking fantastic though
Vamos [NAME], keep fighting! 
How incredibly dangerous
It's legal now in quite a few states. People get booze for Christmas all the time. I'd be stoked.
Hahaha and those pathetic elderly taking computer classes. What worthless trash people XD
I do like how he instantly turns to the pilot. Like, dude, turn around, I dropped my phone!
It's 57% upvoted, which pretty much means most people hate it. 
"""You know, this should have never happened."" Well no shit you dumb ass!"
I dropped him around week 6 and let somebody else deal with that headache
Luckily I don‚Äôt like beer so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that.. but my love for bread more than makes up for that!
ONLY FUCKING MERRILL WOULD MISS THAT
You‚Äôre not wrong, the red flags are there. You have every right to be concerned.
I love how they have it on the dog. Imagine a fur missile going after a suspect flashing red and blue.
Me whenever I wear heels lol I literally look around to make sure no one is watching then proceed to do my penguin like walk üòÇ
[NAME] died for our shins
FUCK LES BRUNS
They're all the same, all the ratemes are a trap. It's just sad people keep falling for them because its so obvious it genuinely hurts.
im not happy with tonight either but no need to make a bad situation worse by just bitching about everything and anything.
[NAME] why can I relate so much.
What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
he wanted to piss off his neighbor next door that yells at people fir walking in his grass.
Aww fuckballs, I thought it was today :( My bad.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** aerosvision! ^(hug)
I do not, sorry! I am not talented in the ways of making/editing videos.
He doesn't really fit, he is more of a mid range shooter. Plus we already have to many players at power forward who are better.
Plymouth: Confederate flags Diesel pick up trucks Dead factories Heart disease and disappointment
True but still very unlikely, mostly just vocal harassment and maybe a few small objects. Something tells me police will be there
As someone who just drunkenly told his boss what everyone else said about him behind his back, I can agree. 
Intrusive thoughts happen in anxiety disorders, although I'm not sure if that's what you're describing here
Oh come on, you can't mention Psi-Ops without linking the theme song!
Last week was her week. She killed everything about that episode
We need more boards and to create a bit more space for [NAME]. Then we‚Äôll be good.
"Lmao ""guys I was *coerced* into sending her a picture of my junk"". That just sounds dumb as hell "
You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!
no, thanks for asking 
If they're not spending this year on [NAME] or [NAME], I have no faith for them to spend on big free agents in the near future
You are welcome! Love to you on the journey!
I know I've heard this phrase before but it's driving me crazy not remembering what it's from Please save me from my torment
I was never a fan of it. It should be a regular foul.
"Agreed. If anyone was ""murdered by words"" it was all the posts, including the top posts that make [NAME] look like an idiot."
Iunno, I laughed.
They didn't even spell his actor's name correctly...
Rusty you the bomb! I'm okish now but just knowing you are out there makes me smile! Cheers! xoxo
I guess but we love each other.
Never seen this. Thank you for sharing
we definitely don't need more people on this overcrowded planet.
I could crush him like a bug right now.
Ouch, my heart. I never even thought about this...
I don‚Äôt get it :(
That's the best part, I can't even imagine to live forever with my shitty body
I'm REALLY glad the guy saved him but seeing him so pitiful and scared really lingers with me. :(
This is pretty funny
Damnit - I'm blind. It's 6am here - I should really go to sleep, but I want to see what happens next.
He did tell me we would play catch when he returned so I am excited about that
You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
No one does... that what makes it so provocative.
oh [NAME] I unleashed the beast
It's so focused on the presenter and he is so unengaging it's painful.
What an interesting thread you referenced in your response!
Based on her other post she's young, pregnant and possibly homeless. Looking for help and advice.
That face is awesome!
Pretty sure their subreddit makes one of these for every game. They're pretty legit.
Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
What? I don‚Äôt just want to sleep with him. I want more idk... I value myself
Sure you can, but the question is whether or not the kid will listen, or if you will upset the parent. 
If Ww3 breaks out in northern Asia as people expect. It will make things worse for you guys in the states - not better
Did you have to make this picture yourself because it‚Äôs just wonderful
Win what exactly? A meaningless game in a very long season to be swept out of the playoffs? No thanks.
Yeah, which is not helping citizens with continued attempted scamming. 
Splendorinthetrash is a genius, undoubtedly!
My problem with history in school is we learned about American history every year, which meant we learned a lot of the same stuff over and over.
Your friend should be disowned by their family
I pray to [NAME] that we will be aware of people's sins in the afterlife when we watch them burn.
Thank you very much! I will get some courage and do this.
"I would say something like ""Hey I've seen you around school... You were in(class)"""
Oh I can't wait until they have sole rights to our game.
This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
"""I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself."" Thank you [NAME]. "
Get some help with your decision. Maybe your church or some non-profit group in your area can talk you through it. Good luck! Keep us updated.
Thanks! Going to try this the next time I'm at work
I love PnR
Fucking hell...
Write down the problems and how you feel when and after you have them. Then take that to therapy and actually get vulnerable with your therapist.
Dear [NAME], please help [NAME] be less disgusting. Amen.
I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends
Just piss off
Anything is a dildo of you're brave enough
Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.
[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
He most likely saw you and just didn‚Äôt care. Sadly.
>I hope that really incredible sex is in your future. Thank you. Also, you should write fortune cookies! 
Stotts raising Nurk's usage rate is making me a happy fan
Thank you. I found out I can return it since they made it heavier than I ordered.
Thank you üëç
Service Ontario isn't a ministry, and I don't believe you're close friends with the heads of two ministries at all. 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt discipline my kid!‚Äù
Now that's ride sharing!
I know! Or close the door of the room where the baby is sleeping? It's too sad for the poor thing to be locked inside.
Hopefully once [NAME] comes back, ZAR has earned a spot on the 2nd line LW.
One of the scariest things about being in a cult is that you don't realize you're in a cult.
Bro, this is not what this sub is for.
Oh. Thanks. I was too lazy to read the [NAME] and just presented my opinion. My bad
Thank you! I do so love making people laugh, and when they let me know I did good.
Im on an SNRI, desvenlafexine, and it has honestly been life changing. I have zero side effects from it, whereas SSRIs made me worse 
"Super petty. The story makes you sound pretty jealous and controlling, as well. Especially the ""SJW"" line... It sounds like a 16-year-old incel. "
Definitely not the norm in KY or other bible belt states, sadly. My extended family looks upon my CF lifestyle with nothing but bingo's.
This is really scary. The saddest about this is i really think it will be possible quite soon. :(
Whoa! Very impressive. One of the better photos of Brisbane I've seen in a while.
I draw with a wacom tablet, and I want to be an animator, maybe some game stuff down the line
I saw the video and liked it, but I should say: Man, you almost make me dizzy by moving your head that much. üòÄüòÄ
Mr. [NAME] Moderate himself. I do hope the DCCC pours money into [NAME] rematch campaign when he declares.
Wait project players magically become great without showing any improvement who would have thought!!!
Im sorry, my autocorret happened. But i think you can read between the lines? Or maybe just go full r*** :)
because it's a morning ritual and i like the smell and taste
I‚ÄôM NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THE SKIN, DEE! I‚ÄôM NOT ALLOWEDDDDD!
I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!
Thank you! I was hoping somebody wpuld post that video since I couldnt think of what to search for.
Cheers for that!
True. I think the only way vegan lab-grown meat could be produced is via self-renewing stem cells which is still a very undeveloped technology
But it's still raping infantry. The case rounds OHK infantry up close. It's just horrendously weak against planes now...
I saw this to, thanks tho :) it helps but not as much as I'd like
How ignorant of to care about the safety and well-being of others! Shame!
I love it when people have a background in STEM and the arts and manage to pursue both!
I‚Äôm on mobile and I can see them. Omg it makes me so happy üòÇ never noticed if before either. iPhone btw
Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
This is the proper timing
[NAME]? Man that laugh when the captain joked that she can read minds. Kinda embarrassing.
It's not much, but it's honest work.
[NAME] what a stupid job
Yeah i don't want them to know to early it ruins the fun.
He was cut yesterday, unfortunately
I feel so stupid. I‚Äôve never made the connection between [NAME] refusing to play for SD and [NAME]
I love in SoSpaHa - south of Spanish Harlem.
Yes, you're supposed to keep it. Like I said, its only when the voice gets out of control that you should start to worry.
Be brave Star Wars fans. You've likely been analyzing RotJ wrong your entire life. OP has it all figured out. Amazing. I love you.
That's not a denial ü§î
Welcome to the party pal!
Unfortunately I'm guessing their toxic attitude will alienate them from others, which will only make them more angry and resentful.
Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true
The soviet union was state capitalist? So was china?? Is this deluded meme still alive wtf?! Lol grow up you helplessly indoctrinated idiots
Thank you so much.
Can't make negative comments about her on here dude. Downvotes incoming
[NAME] was my favorite. And I liked [NAME] her first season. They both suck now, so damn hard.
Is that were its from ? All i know is since i was young that is scary af !
*Dread it, run from it* *[NAME] still arrives*
She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.
Thank you - you may call me daddy.
I like how you're insinuating that the other half is family reunification rather than giving us the real answer.
just speculation at this point but it's not looking good
Lovely day we're having.
so kids never go into a locker room and see adults nude?? i cant believe everyone is condemning this. this is nothing.
all the more reason to not give a fuck about CFF
I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
good one. 2 one liners so far.
Famous for his 3-4 Defense
That logic doesn't work. Porn stars make movies knowing they are going to be seen, but it is still objectification. 
only suckers believe this don't be a sucker
Dude, you look fine bro. Even at 26 and still in school. You‚Äôre fine bro.
I prefer the term window licker. The pub community loves the taste of windex.
I love Skyline Chili but I totally understand why other people don't. Same with Imo's.
They can't they need a morty dumbness shield
Funny thing is he kind of said just that jokingly in the [NAME] interview yesterday
This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
Fire the ux designers and yes also our beloved [NAME]
I actually like my vagina... I suspect it‚Äôs actually my husband that is the problem
PM me if you need more info. Good luck! Its tough haha
"I laughed so hard at that episode, I remember my parents coming into my room asking ""What happened, are you ok?"""
Slightly obscure I like it. I‚Äôll add crash.
I watch it 4-5 times every time it comes up. I think there is something wrong with me...
Lol this match was like 1/3rd the time of what I expected
Ah ok I thought by terrific you mean terrific at reducing speeding since (I think) that is the policy objective. Cheers!
Nope. You're a weirdo.
Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
It‚Äôs harder when you have kids with the partner.
Stay strong [NAME]
In the USA you won‚Äôt disappear for badmouthing the USA. That‚Äôs what I love about it.
in away that smarter than the average six year old
Right?? It makes no sense she‚Äôs horrible
Thanks. Screw the cancellation rate, it‚Äôs worth denying <4.7. Good to know!
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. 
> If it was a nationalist reaction to globalism, it was English nationalism, not British. This was and is discussed way too little.
i can also post pics of the receipt if anyone doesn‚Äôt believe me!!!
Glad to see that [NAME] no more is a fellow r/Atheist user and anti-Peterson
Oh good one. It‚Äôs insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
Wet dreams don't count
Ehhh kill streaks aka point streaks in bfv.. Not impressed. That game is booty water bf1 is way more fun
Just be there for him in the best way you can. Look out for him but also keep yourself in mind. It's all you can do
This is the cutest shit I've seen all day.
I think you may be missing some of the public information posted by QCX employees over the past year but I think your posted information is mostly correct.
Is it something you run into commonly with older adults? Sounds like in some ways it may make your job easier. Thanks for your work!
HEY! Once I was out on my own, I **loved** getting socks and underwear as gifts. My son just realized the same thing.
The worst Alabama loss under [NAME]. It was a good day.
Omg, this is hilarious 
Don't forget about foden, I love [NAME], I even bought his shirt at the start of this season, but foden has an even greater ceiling
Hahaha, good point
that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.
hmm... it didnt work for me when i posted it but now it does... weird af
I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
When they touch my arm or shoulder while talking. Usually they do it with no sexual intent at all, but it still gives me butterflies. 
shucci a lil BITCH
I dont think anyone liked 6A apart from the two Slade episodes and the crossover. Most people here consider it to be sloppy
Lmao. Thank God [NAME] lost and [NAME] crushed the souls of these lunatics in 2016
Damn [NAME] let himself go
Oh come on! Stop posting this stuff. FFS will you think of my blood pressure!? You‚Äôre killing me (figuratively speaking).
I feel like he would be most people in a flat out race, those prosthetics look beastly (in the good way).
I wear sweet scents and get compliments from men on how good I smell quite a bit Good thing I love sweet vanilla,Amber,berry scents 
Stop lying to me
Wow [NAME] went cold... can‚Äôt wait to see [NAME] find out why!
[NAME]! Get a DAMN good lawyer! Glad you're okay.
Personally my number one ST love is [NAME], [NAME] is a close second tho.
This guy hasn't learned his lesson. Bake 'im away, toys!
we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.
What the hell did you just type?
That's my favorite! It smells so good without being overpowering.
I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah
A pencil skirt is tight around the hips with a slit in the back, not swishy. Does that make sense?
"Knew [NAME] would go for it. Again, love that fake-worry shade he throws. Just add ""biting nails"" and he could star in movies!"
I fucking love ten min power hour xD
"I absolutely love that idea ""BuT a CoP tOlD mE"""
They are angry virgin children because he plays the game like it was supposed to be played. SOT has the most pathetic community ever.
Have fun getting arrested for child porn then! Check your DM‚Äôs üòâ
I don't think it's that simple. There was a lot riding on making 7 and taking too many risks probably isn't the best answer.
Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt realize that journalists weren‚Äôt actually autonomous humans that can think for themselves.
Well, exactly that actually, lol. 
They need more with more items because I've never been able to get same day.
Ty. I confessed and they are being very nice to me. My kids are safe and me going to therapy is a plus now.
Congrats dude! I hope my shitstuation turns around as greatly as yours did.
Those cards are so cool
So much fake news.
I love that I‚Äôm smart, but not so smart that I‚Äôm socially awkward.
So, so many hugs and high fives! You are an awesome momma. 
Yeah personally I would‚Äôve brought [NAME] back lol [NAME] always had trouble staying healthy
I got offered a couple of batches. They weren't 100% terrible but I feel like they could've been better so I didn't take them.
Hostile ? I disagree.
I've seen Shot Caller. That's what I've decided prison is... so yeah. Sorry boys.
I would but they don't make anything that fits my needs.
Seriously?! These [NAME] have no common decency or respect for others suffering!
If they are [NAME] supporters who are now reaping what they sowed, the laughing is appropriate.
This is beautiful and accurate
Ones with close ties to SA, anyway. An escaped apostate won't exactly be itching to run home.
No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
Your stupidity and your attempt to reframe the argument when the facts are laid out clearly is astounding LOL
[NAME] you sound like my father, I feel sorry for you
Wow first fight in a while where I don't want either dude to lose.
Wtf is a weeb
been there dont remember where exactly it is but so much fun
What the problem? I mean, steak? Good. Doughnuts? Good!! I don‚Äôt see an issue. 
Oh mate! Happy days. haha. Yeah I totally thought you were starting a course of Radiotherapy haha. All good
the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity
Haha yeah. Are the squat toilets that prevalent? I‚Äôm hoping to avoid them when I go.
[NAME] family must be having a field day there today!
25 m from Canada! out for 10 years now! I'd love to make a new penpal!
I have no idea what your post means but I love your name and you are one of us
" You're lecturing other people and you can't even spell ""Dwig***H***t""."
Shithole universe i mean.
Why does everyone keep assuming that we‚Äôll suddenly sign big name FA‚Äôs? This is a terrible idea.
Obligatory fuck the dodgers
I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
"Maybe I'm crazy but to me it looks like she's just giving a ""thank you"" nod"
You've sparked my interest and made some solid points. I think i'll make some calls and reconsider. Thank you!
Why the fuck would you go for pizza, subs or pork rolls in texas?
I wouldn‚Äôt cause I already know my area so well I don‚Äôt want other drivers with that knowledge
Well I am the son of a parent who legally immigrated from the [RELIGION] country of Turkey so no thanks jackass.
Notley-nomics helps grow the economy once again! Thank [NAME] we have such good governance.
The light socket doesn‚Äôt provide any light, so it‚Äôs useless.
Wow...Mean [NAME] passed away today. RIP
I don‚Äôt see the yes yes yes yes part. Just one big no.
Beautiful!!! I always accidentally miss the 45 S exit at this location.
At least a feed of diazies stops me shitting the bed over the idea of a man wearing a dress. Uppa fuckin erps!!!
No. It‚Äôs creepy.
She shouldn‚Äôt have to fight a male.
What‚Äôs irritates me so much is that rework ideas like this do all the work for ubi, yet they still won‚Äôt do it. 
Thanks for comin' out.
[NAME] IS SO OLD HIS FAVORITE ROUTES ARE TO THE CVS AND CRACKER BARREL.
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Thank you! My Bravo blog is
I solo climbed to Master as main DPS with 60hz. It really doesnt matter.
That was so damn cute. She looks just like [NAME] and I bet it just melts his heart to see how mature that girl is
at sunset i want to bang my wife there on the rock
Is it weird that I was practically drooling while watching this
This is why I love baseball
I really like this.
I have seen some terrible minion stuff, I thought I've seen the worst of the worst. I was wrong...I was horribly wrong.
gotta love my s-tier talking to people anxiety haha wait no i don't üòé
Pro? Everyone does is and that makes it even more rude.
You're beautiful! Your sister is a great photographer too, this photo looks so natural! 
You don't get to decide what is discussed in this thread. You are not in charge here.
Stop master debating, you are making a fool out of yourself. It's concerning.
Well it didn‚Äôt work that well, I mean... they lost
> this racist rant. Pretty amazing to drop the N word while trying to talk about incivility and decorum.
Congratulations, there are success stories in this group. Forge on with your life but watch out for other (jerkfaces). 
Yeah this angle is nauseating.
bruh is trash and has been for a long long time. y'all won. congrats. see you in Death Valley.
I love seeing satan... I mean saban upset
Oh yea [NAME] from Danganronpa 1 is great too, a cute hacker girl and one of my fave charas from the franchise! ‚ú®
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
She looks like a [NAME].
Yes. Some things are simply not allowed.
Guy looks like average [NAME] at the gym. Reddit acts like he the new anabolic king üòÇ I will go back to my cave now.
I looked this person up. She‚Äôs a real doctor
You can't just ignore [NAME]' cup wins though.
It‚Äôs good dude I had to have it explained to me I‚Äôm just passing on the love
The Internet is a weird place.
Happy New Year you wonderful mummy you! I was thinking about you today and hoping you were doing okay ‚ò∫
Struggling to get the basics with a $1,000 phone. Y‚Äôall need a reality check 
The man and dog have been spotted running past [NAME] and nobody is helping! I would help but I just had my nails done.
Lol i control your life gooferton btw open your chatbox
this is just brother and sister but with extra steps
Because it's a rejection of oneself, rather than acceptance. It's an expression of insecurity. It's not healthy.
She has major SBüòñ
Pretty sure he's by far and away the biggest asshat on this sub lmao
True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. 
They also have the best lemon bars!
We haven‚Äôt had much luck either. We wish you and Aunt [NAME] the best. Stay strong! Thank you for the kind words.
Why shall I? It‚Äôs too much fun reading comments written by distorted bubble people ;)
> it‚Äôs a low f-ing bar lbr It is indeed. But I am glad that you found a man who doesn't want anal.
Damn furries. We don't have animal ears!
Really? I‚Äôm not so sure, because I really do like her a lot.
Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I‚Äôm so sorry
Yep. Tough week for [NAME]. Not shooting well, first ejection and fine, ripping out jerseys, first triple double and the DSJ drama. 
Drink the kool-aid! Lol
I don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt post that hog.
BNW is scarily accurate if you ask me.
Oh, fuck off. It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô means you specifically. 
For Citynews dot ca that is really sad.
I was hoping this would be a case of r/maliciouscompliance It was close.
This is legit an awesome idea. There‚Äôs a reason rifles are shouldered like that. Makes it easier to stabilize it. Stability is important in photography
Maybe, I'm just saying that there are players with more talent out the gate than him.
My misunderstanding, I thought you were questioning why people thought we needed a change.
"Or talk like this. No one describes a super-computer like mind as ""intuitive."" It doesn't even really make sense"
WE can't always have what we want. I see them losing.
that doesn't make any sense at all.
thank you! This is what I thought she said as well
Yeah you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not fit for the position! Thank you for giving me the right words to say. 
My grandmother-in-law does this. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.
Nervously laughs in anxiety
Whenever I have felt it would work. I wasn't always right but it never hurt to ask.
Interesting!!
Yes he is a hard worker for sure. Just wish he could get his shot back on track.
Thank you for this!
Decent idea [NAME] have an analog shot to see what to do...
My worst fear when I finally get over someone Those damn what ifs
>Bad request. this is some dank-tier meme that I'm not authorised to see, thanks [NAME]!
Thank you !
Fair enough. I would suggest practice but it seems you've got that under wraps. Gd luck out there.
Damnnnn nice feed bro. That choke throw to the spin attack was on point.
But OP said her life is ruined because 'muricans are bad.
What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.
>a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
No, so it's not our kingdom
Bringing it up now because you and many like you made this sub a hostile environment for voices of reason. Eat crow.
You're the best !
Because I suck at lying and they will have to find out about him eventually
Yeh your right a bitter parra fan, have fun with norms him a bell end will get on fine
Are they jealous that they are playing a better sport.
Honestly I‚Äôd believe it. [NAME] seems stuck in that high school mentality
True, haha. Anywho, have a great day.
You gotta make yourself happy when no one else does
Thanks! That was an interesting read. Seems there really is a city where they built more homes than there were people to live there!
I love how all of you toss the blame on [NAME] as if [NAME] isn't just as responsible..gotta love revisionist history
Yea ok.
Thank you for being open to self reflection and for sharing this.
I like your babyüòç
That is the end-all and be-all of the situation. if you feel upset or insecure you should definitely be creeped out as he's doing it.
this is a truly remarkable and informative documentary, and well worth setting aside an evening to watch. 
Sorry if I‚Äôm late to the party but when does the new season start? I‚Äôm getting withdrawals! Happily ever after that is.
Thank you.
Hey. I like you
HAHAHAHA!!!!!
I love [NAME]. He's another great option for 6th man.
Great job, now let's get two points.
Not guarantee. Only increased risk with time.
I hope you everyone is serious about not being a bulls fan anymore. Get out of here if this is what ends your fandom.
Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.
"I'm so disappointed you didn't include [NAME] ""I'm standing under the source of the bull shit"" [NAME]"
Yes Thank you ! Someone might try to sue me because they pulled out and got pregnant ... use full body condoms if you think Facebook should support your baybeeees
I‚ÄôLL SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME
digitally executed lol.
I'm disappointed [NAME] never plays guitar again.
It‚Äôs crazy that people know this and yet rake [NAME] over the coals for not wanting to talk to [NAME].
Cholent powered rockets will fly men to the moon'üé∂
Me too! I don't believe in likes or karma points, but I know other people care and it might be the highlight of their day.
His last post to T_D was to try and rile people up to get [NAME]
This is straight up depressing
nice ideas! looking good.
Bhahaha! I‚Äôm sorry, that sounds awful.
I like Abram wayyyy more that Rapp. I hope we can snag Abram so we can use our first two picks to fill other holes.
I‚Äôm so sorry. <3
I have adhd whats so bad about it?
She might just be bitter over her own relationship and this is a painful reminder in some way.
lol a milquetoast anarchist‚Äôs take on Marxism
The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
Skin starvation is a real thing. People can actually go crazy without social physical contact. Take care of yourself OP. *hugs*
I really like this play on words.
"You should check out [NAME] ""thank you God"" "
Well you needn't worry about it I won't be coming back to that floating turd you call a country
good luck buddy
yep. Sucks don't it? You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. 
The fact that big corporations that made their successes off capitalism are embracing Marxism is really disturbing.
Fuck me, that is good. 
Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story
Man I love how venezuela is a dictatorship when it has 4.5 times less prisoners per capita than the US
Hang on so Im not allowed to stroke your dog? Thats sad.
Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
Ha, I just saw that highlight. nasty
I will upvote any gif that has [NAME] as Dr. [NAME] in it. I loved her performance in Maniac.
I‚Äôve never heard of this website! Thanks for letting me know.
[NAME] has shot the three well the past few games. great to see
When the caterer found out [NAME] was going to pay the bill out of his own pocket, perhaps they declined the honour.
Didn't even get a chuckle out of me. I guess its just too high brow for my dumb brain.
Cheers, girl! But yeah, he could return her, but no refund or exchanges for him! 
aha my favorite reply :)
[NAME] is an arrogant schmuk but he‚Äôs good at what he does.
Last nights euro run had over a foot for most of the area lol. Its probably overdone but still crazy
Fuck it, it's time we spend not adding to the debt
Struggling to find :(
There‚Äôs a reason southern states have a massive teacher shortage. Please do yourself a favor a consider that before you take the leap.
He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME].
Sorry I haven't been keeping up to date, what happens next week?
So edgy.
> Get used to it, the cons are back. I just wish that they were pros instead of cons
Oh don‚Äôt get me started about halo, the glory days
Right!? I'm glad someone else noticed. I was horrified when she trespassed into a stranger's home. So violating!
Everyone who supports him knows. The [NAME] need educating.
This shit had me howling, which I can't say happens too often. Didn't expect to see comedic gold in that sub.
[NAME] has been a lot better since he stopped doing Xanax with [NAME]
The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
I got second hand embarrassment so hard my face is still red after few minutes of glancing at one of those google docs.
yes, also most donut shops like those are cambodian just fyi.
Yeah thanks.
But this isnt about a comic book movie. It's a cartoon. Also this is a right wing website...so how does this not count?
You came at me with attacks, so no, you get NOTHING!
Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.
[NAME] has really given his all in the second half. He must be exhausted
She has some really good dance moves honestly!
I want a pizza flair!!
You went from hot to hot, that‚Äôs crazy!
Ahhhh [NAME], you‚Äôve done it again.
"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
I tried to write a cheque for a fare when I was a teenager. That did not go down well.
Ah that's so cool!!
This is a very long story about nothing
These are some of the best movies to watch high (esp Butterfly Effect)
You're a horrible person.
Thank you! Does anyone actually if you'll be able to buy this (outside of Japan)?
That‚Äôs actually interesting to me
Everyone makes the NREMT test sound like the devil. It really isn't that bad.
Cute. üíñ
Fuck yea!
> They are working on something new... TLWGAS. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm too dumb to figure out what that stands for
Awesome! I'm really excited. Are you there too?
This might be the most NYC fit I've ever seen.
"I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks ""by-my-self"" is how to write that."
Thank you, and same to you. I was a single AP once, it was lonely. Do you see other people?
Cancel as soon as you can it‚Äôs far more enjoyable!!!!
This is disgusting. *secretly gets horny* I've had it with this sub. *opens new incognito tab*
I don't care about him at all. üò§üò§üò§
I am having fun haha :D *creeper mode on* jk lol
I loved this place but I would only go for the big Blockbusters. It was the best IMAX theater in Minnesota hands down RIP
Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.
You are wrong.
I‚Äôll buy it i don‚Äôt care
damn, i always get in on these too late
It hurts to look at it
Omg I‚Äôd happily live in Cape Town instead of the US!! It‚Äôs literally one of my favorite cities on earth!!
Bitch ass n*** [NAME] rooting for [NAME]
19??? Yikes slow down, enjoy yourselves and figure yourselves out. Not an age to make big decisions like that, I say at 24...
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.
Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top.
Oop my bad
Too bad he endorses seiko, this wouldve been a great ad
Absolutely not! If religions didn‚Äôt exist on this planet, we would be a far more advanced society.
movie sucks do yourself a favor and watch the Infernal Affairs trilogy they bastardized
Take the child from them! Wtf? Theyre so dumb. You always secure the kids seat!
Son of a bitch... here we go. Can't just stand there guys....
Thanks! Fridays...and Saturdays...and Sundays...all gonna be long, lol. Ack!
I'm happy for you. May you and the boys have many happily ever afters!
This is awesome. Thank you!!!!
If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control.
I love him!
So..... it looks like dude is willing to break his own neck to help a vegan who is choking.
[NAME], He's got the name that you'd love to touch...
Do you have a source for this claim. Seems promising but would love to dig into it.
That‚Äôs not proof.
Yeah, I just visited there and it seems more disordered than this sub... Strange
This‚Äôs didn‚Äôt hold up too well.
I'm not white.
He will the author already spoiled it in previous chapters.
[NAME] i really hate entitled people. Upvote if you think that EPs are worse than Antivaxxers.
People‚Äôs shame and cultural oppressions regarding sexual behavior is responsible for all the world‚Äôs woes.
Been saying this shit for years. Sorry not sorry
Hi let‚Äôs not compare basketball to the man speaking out against a dictator and fearing for his life because of it thank you
Oh I love flirtationships! This is normally us, but work takes us to a long distance relationship half of the year. 
He‚Äôd probably be on best behavior... for a while.
Nice, thanks!!
Happy cake day brother!
Dont worry, they are the best surgeons in the hospital and they will remove the tumor in no time
Sorry bucko r/necrophilia got taken down, I think your in the wrong place buddy. Here I‚Äôll call you an Uber, take care of yourself. 
Damn... somebody got told.
Because all those delusional people be doing the same shit in their real life.
"Or more aptly ""OHHHHH FUUUUUuuuck"" As you see me run away."
Short answer, fuck no, don't ever fall for it. Don't make the same mistake Canada has.
I‚Äôm a HR professional and deal with this all the time. You‚Äôd be surprised how ignorant most people are about their paychecks.
I love the guy but can't see this working out well. That being said if he plays as the furthest forward of the midfield 3- who knows.
That isn't entirely fair. We're also for harboring regular ol' right trolls, too.
Mrs.Frizzle has found herself on hard times.
Like thanks for your valuable input?
Removed? Damn no respect.
The King of DoorDash. Great work as always.
No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*
Man I love listening to [NAME] talk and I‚Äôd love to have a chat with him but he does talk some bollocks sometimes.
We got nowhere with that because you only drop one-liners and refuse to actually engage.
This just makes me angry.
No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
i love all harper news because i love the shit storm that ensues on here.
My heart is broken for this woman... I really hope she finds the strength to leave him
Yeah, but the sound of a fork against the stainless would be absolutely unbearable. 
It's all so beautiful, right? 
There is nothing adorable about that terrifying man
I hate fags
[NAME]. And I‚Äôm not even trolling. I seriously love him.
No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
There's a difference between use and ownership. They aren't equivalent.
I love Big Brother, they make an appointment and come pick up used household goods and clothes. Easiest way to donate.
British would annoy me more. Or being called British Isles
Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?
OOF, well if im dancing with someone i dont really look at their crotch so im pretty surd ur fine. How old are u
That sucks. You could start one yourself if you like.
Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
Amazing. The perfect words for it
That guy‚Äôs an asshole. He behavior doesn‚Äôt inherently have anything to do with poly.
Break ups are painful and there‚Äôs no way to avoid that. Be honest with your current girl and end it.
What is with the pet worship? Should be more worried about your elderly relatives.
Thank you for fading
Damned straight.
That‚Äôs one of the many sleeping cycles of my fucked-up schedule :)
Idk why but your comment in particular made me audibly crack tf up
The fact that you put [NAME] above [NAME] is proof that you‚Äôre a troll or mentally handicapped.
Yeah , yeah you can‚Äôt change my mind , you‚Äôll get there eventually .
Just got my seats a couple of days ago!
my soul has long been destroyed :( it‚Äôs over for us nosoulcels
Means behave like you are a sexual Tyrannosaurus.
We don't care as much for 69. Hard to do properly. Glad it works for you. We prefer to take turns.
I would make sure I didn‚Äôt leave any soda cans anymore so I could have the high ground, and then hide all but one cup lol
Almost heaven...
Who‚Äôs fucking a shark !?
"""A lion never stretches before it hunts."" ... Glad to see he's already on board with Green Bays injury first mindset. "
[NAME] was half-blood but it wasn't a smart idea to bring up his father.
It‚Äôs been a pleasure, as I‚Äôm sure it always is with you.
That is absolutely terrifying to me. Oh my god. The idea that she was trapped as a toddler her entire life is just... wow.
My no. 1 favorite quote on the show right here
[NAME] Wednesday‚Äôs üòé Good to know he‚Äôs enjoying the retirement life. 
I hope the bleeding didn‚Äôt last long
Yeah wat a fucking knob right? Fucking nick...
Still an ad hominem and not a legitimate argument or counterpoint :)
Props to the guy for being honest
I don‚Äôt think anyone will miss me either aha
No it‚Äôs a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
I misread World Championship of Carp-fishing to be the World Championship of Cat-fishing...
Man I thought [NAME] was going to be the real deal. I wanted [NAME] gone so bad around that time.
I wonder how Florida will like him hahah
Cool reaaaaally cool and thank you verry much is all i can say and that i will do that
I'm so glad I saw this!!! Now I know how to wash my face! I can't wait for the tooth brushing tutorialü§ó
username definitely checks out
Sorry the cognitive dissonance is too much for you. Why don't you go back to listening to Nickelback? It'll make you feel better :)
I still hate Catcher Eggman!
Id be pretty pissed if my prime didn't auto renew
love you too.
Oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck RIGHT OFF!!!!!
Yeah that is definitely tough on the processor as it's running a software emulator and the game the whole time
What does she want? No sex with you! Your giving up which is what she wants! She wins and you lose. Pretty simple!
she usually sits below the bathroom sink like a fuckin weirdo between 9-11 pm but she'll be free after.
Better than just saying hey :)
Watch the ignorance of a variety of topics manifest itself as word diarrhea just falling out of her dumb mouth.
Sticking his tongue out.... ugh
That's beautiful.
Meh, whenever I travel with someone who can't walk fast, I just wait for the next train.
Literally all of them have said and done MUCH worse than anything [NAME] has.
Don‚Äôt be a class traitor
I‚Äôm sorry you were down voted. I am asking for real honesty, so thank you for telling yours.
"[NAME] was the ""socialist"" freshman House Rep. I liked the most, but her recent [NAME] tweets are extremely concerning."
Thank you so much.
Lovely. You enjoy that train of thought lad.
I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!
That's a great dream. I love how your inner voice of him came out. It feels right on.
Wow. Thank you so much. I really appreciate this.
But i like being the trickiest of traps üò£
I had a nightmare about something similar, the combination of high walls and water is truly scary
[NAME] a fucking creeper. Doesn't he have some weird ass relationship with that 14 year old girl from Stranger Things?
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.
OH [NAME] THAT'S TERRIFYING SOMEBODY SAVE US ^/s
[NAME] might be all those things, but he pissed me off canceling his appearances at Coachella and Gov‚Äôs Ball. Very unwavy of him 
[NAME] was horrid for us
Sorry for the late question but I wanted to know if can you buy 2 tickets with one Madridista membership? Or is it one ticket per Madridista membership?
Don‚Äôt worry! I was never convicted of anything!
Man pre ASG Yankees were absolutely fun to watch. Judge hitting that homerun was awesome
Yep, unprepared for first period, forgot my pants while wandering around the school, etc. Been teaching 5 years and I still get these dreams
I tip my invisible hat anytime I drive past this dealership. What an unfortunate surname.
Hahah Yea imagine what the GM guys will do when the DD app crashes for hours
Huh.. Well that ruins it :/ At least the cats fine
You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:
Is this the track that‚Äôs just [NAME] cat meowing but slowed down? My memory is failing me
I need help with corsets but otherwise would be mortified to need help for every day clothes.
That's the best treasure I could every hope to find
I don‚Äôt think that many people really thought [NAME] would be a game changer.
True despair.
[NAME] from ZoE and [NAME] from TTGL. Actually fuck all that [NAME] from The Big O is where it's at.
The thing is, they've whipped themselves into such a rabid frenzy, literally anything less than the apocalypse is going to be a bit underwhelming.
LOL. Glad you noticed.
Happy birthday my guy! Hope you have a great day today, tomorrow, and every day after that. You and everyone deserve a good day. üòÉ
If you‚Äôre concerned about [NAME], then you must still be concerned about [NAME]. WAR over last 2 seasons: [NAME]: 4.8, 3.1 [NAME]: 4.0, 3.6
I turned the news on around 6 this morning and have never been so happy to have a commute of 4 miles to my job
I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
These are some of the lamest threatening letters I‚Äôve ever seen. She‚Äôs a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
> Well maybe I dodged an argument with an idiot From the sounds of it I'm almost positive you did. Have a good one :)
> I‚Äôm tired of being realistic and open minded. Me too! Now it is all about being selfish and aloof. Not even kidding.
Go fuck yourself.
You were so close.
The worst is starting out in a new relationship after leaving a failing one. You want to fall but you know how much the breakups hurt
I keep wondering about armpit waxing, but the potential pain scares me. 
My Dachshund loves trying to lick my son's mouth when he's laughing. Every single time.
This moment always reminded me of being a kid and turning on Nickelodeon only to find Nick News with [NAME]. Ultimate disappointment.
This is amazing
Of course it bothers you. She just admitted that something inconsequential to your relationship would be a dealbreaker.
I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly happened. I'm sorry you're having these problems. üôÅ
More worried about the multi-trillion dollars in entitlement programs than 5$ on a wall.
The worst thing they risk is having to become a worker.
[NAME] damn fruit booters.
Riding your bicycle down Powell is *a stupid fucking idea*.
They should have burned that shit to the ground and used the insurance money to buy another used one.
you can please some of the people, some of the time, but you can't please all of the people, all of the time...
Thank you. I‚Äôve got till next week to find out then :)
No I didn't. PM me your username here and I'll reach out to you.
Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.
FUCKING DIN!!!
Much more badass than the union suit.
Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.
My dad has an irrational fear of the dark.
I came here just to bask in this thread. Yesterday was wonderful....it was just wonderful.
Celes represent well her talent tho
"I mean... It's about average. So not $200 but not ""throw it in the trash"" either. "
The sub is VERY socialist so they love this kind of stuff
Grow up.
Then you're saying its about looks, not the misogyny.
may I direct your attention to the aforementioned ‚Äútin foil conspiracy‚Äù
I mean my statement applied to more than just weed but sure...
Wow. That'll teach you to try and help!
She's as beautiful and as happy as ever
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 1937 - 2016 = Polls not very accurate 2016 - 2019 = Oh yeah, polls have evolved, they're like super accurate now 
Hate people like this
And this young man wishes to be an athlete. That sort of strenuous activity would not be possible.
I loved ScienceBowl and KnowledgeBowl in highs school. Wish we had a college bowl.
My 4 month old just got her second round of shots, so yeah, we feel you. Hope you're able to get a good rest!!
No I didn‚Äôt think that, it was the way the information was presented
TV shows. And occasionally movies. I stopped Interstellar at that stupid love speech. Never finished it.
Much thanks!
"""I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, [NAME]?"""
She was a surrogate. [NAME] fucked the force which created [NAME] in schmee
When I was in Uni I worked in a call centre. Pay was better than retail but it was worse on the soul.
thank you, i dont get whats so hard to come to such an easy solution honestly
Thank you, that's very good to know!
I wanna see this line up... not cause I think we‚Äôll win with them but i just want to see it. [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
Is this [NAME] comics? His Simpsons stuff is great
So sorry that was his response. I hope you're able to get free soon so that you can begin to heal and move on.
"I love it when ""bad"" picks actually have fucking amazing ganks."
NFL level catch
I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse.
Shut up cowpoke
u guys were a pretty good place to eat at :( ill miss it
Thank you! :)
Thank you, too. It's nice knowing we're not alone. I hope you stay afloat.
Yes, I did, not once...here is my full story: Story of my dead bedroom
It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
I‚Äôm gonna stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes! Maybe that‚Äôll teach you a lesson.
>call people faggots > lovingly describe the beauty and strength of a man's physique
Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho. 
Great way to clarify! That's the whole point of talking about nebulous stuff like this.
Interesting take there
[NAME] playing great this half
I feel like that's what they both deserve, though. Thank you for the support <3
[NAME] THAT HURTS DON'T DO THAT
Oh man... my grandparents on both sides of the family have passed away and it was tough... we‚Äôre here for you
"""I lost control"" would have been an understandable explanation. ""It lost control"" is not. "
Thank you sir, this has made me happy. 
I'm so sorry. You can do this. Just remember YOU are a person who is worthy of love and respect.
Where do I sign up, then? Haha.
Okay then. Please remind me again why the lack of support is death threats in my PMs.
I look forward to finally trying the game out and helping you guys pump up those kill counts
It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
omg I remember be exactly like this and being so excited, gahhhh I might even believe I‚Äôm more excited than you hahahah.
Theres no way 88% did that grossness.
You'll win in the long run by not shutting up.
Just saying, don‚Äôt give up. Fight back. Do it for your patients 
> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?
"Can you imagine if management was like ""Hey [NAME], we need you to fire the custodian. Thanks."""
HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
If Android: YouTube Vanced is your new best friend. If IOS: sorry lol get a real phone
I believe that show scared straight was actually a massive failure, it got viewers but concept of it never resulted in the kids actually being 'scared straight'.
I have his signature on my jersey. Lined up at Canadian Tire for it when I was younger. Happy retirement!
Which was in 2017. Enjoy your loss and shush. You'd think having 1 win in a month would humble you...
Outraged suburban white moms ranting about stupid things that don‚Äôt matter and making ridiculous comparisons are peak humor
It is. I bet chantex and all the other 'quit smoking' companies hope this book doesn't become too popular. That would cut into their profits.
"Yes, which is why I hate the term ""ranked choice voting""."
I'm not having any thoughts that are safe for me to publicly type.
"This is a ""lose in the 11th round of the shootout"" type game"
Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.
Thanks so much for your reply it helps to hear from others. Good luck on your journey.
Such a great thing to hear. Setting aside my very immense distaste for SA, this really just makes me happy. I love our country.
I am so very, very happy at your last sentence. If you understand that, you will be permanently free.
I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
[NAME], 2 weeks ago got charged $20 and was fake [NAME].
Gangs shooting each other on the streets is not the same as a crazy person going into a school and kill a bunch of innocent kids with an assault rifle.
Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
I deserved it. I'm a garbage cumslut. He owned me and he took his property.
>I don‚Äôt believe in changing the rules and laws however ... Then you believe [RELIGION] is in the 7th century for all times
I have seen this gif like once a week for a year, and I still cringe every time. 
Oh sorry I gotcha
Youre being dowmvoted but you are absolutely correct. I have a feelingnyour downvotes are more a sign of the obesity problem than anything
"You should see the absurd number of ""gays for [NAME]"" we have in my country, it's astounding"
This is a depressing r/tworedditorsonecup
They do a great job until one pops free and smacks you in your junk.
Back at it with the crazy [RELIGION] conspiracies I see. Did you stop taking your pills?
Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**
I think they're all equally bad in their own way.
Interesting, hopefully somebody might be able to provide you an answer.
I want one....i dont care who.... Unarmed charecter
i really like that! I'll start using it moving forward =)
[NAME] i actally kind of like [NAME] but he is such a punk
It's bad when that sounds tasty to me
Real class A asshole there
Ay just like my life *whips whilst sobbing
Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should‚Äôve just taken him.
Your welcome. Hope it all gets better.
Not even slightly.
I really hope that's true and really hope they grow some balls and ban it.
Yeah it looks like it
Same. It's my favorite show to watch in the morning. The whole crew is so likeable.
I like mother lode in weho. A bit loud but actively un-douchy.
"Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
Same here. My refund almost doubled from last year. I almost cried when I saw how much I'm getting back.
Sounds like a horror junkie in the making. Congrats dad, you‚Äôll have a buddy to watch movies with in a year or two!
Although these are seemingly overpriced, yes, I adore these pieces.
You just made me so happy.
I cut onions to hide my feelings.
Unable. It's not really possible. It's not his only interest but it's the one I can't really do anything about.
He was going for a new record for fastest to the bottom.
I would like a hug
This makes me so happy for you ‚ô•Ô∏è I am glad you are getting the right kind of support you need!
If he does well, do you guys think that's a sign that we could flip a senate seat? I like [NAME] a lot.
This is genius. The ultimate prank.
 It an argument. Don‚Äôt really have time for jack-assery. Lot of people want attention from me tonight, not just you. 
I got I got I got...
I unironically approve of this message. It is time for the French Revolution to end.
Wow this is amazing. LOVE THIS!!!
Leafs would have won this game if it wasn‚Äôt for that bullshit overturn.
2 or 1 seed we‚Äôre still playing a bad team in the first round
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
[NAME] so much hate.
LOL, you‚Äôre a good sport. In all seriousness pretty cool picture.
Drives to work, realizes its a holiday because nobody answers their phones. Still stuck at work... nothing to do. We dont get paid holidays :(
No, they don‚Äôt. No morning after pills/contraception pills are free, even at the clinics
People keep giving serious arguments but you keep replying ‚Äúbut mah happiness‚Äù Not worth it to lose time arguing with the likes of you
Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don‚Äôt know if those facts are even rightüòÇüòÇ
I'm keeping my mouth shut. I don't want you yokels crowding up the wine store I go to.
Hahahahah, I will consider
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs from when she was abused when she was pregnant and lost the baby.
Holy shit. Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
Fuck her... don‚Äôt live to make your parents happy
This man just posts facts and got -220. He told them the truth and they hated him for it.
ATM has scored only 27 goals in 19 games and have 38 points from it, frankly really outrageous. They keep shithousing a win.
Please. Sorry.
you forgot miracle, fake fan
I laughed at this 4 years ago.
‚ÄúShe had the same expression as the shocked Pikachu meme.‚Äù Lmao.. this made me laugh so hard lol
Wow that has to be the best advice I‚Äôve ever gotten. Thank you
Same here! I was addicted to her and beaus stories during their trip to Europe right before filming this season. They are the best!
If loving the Falcons along side my Vikings is wrong, *than I don‚Äôt want to be right.*
Every time [NAME] is in one of these things, I keep remembering that Trinity Soul exists. It was not a very memorable show. 
Dan cool and rich
Prey actually had portals before Portal. Such an underrated game.
I hope an elk will gore anyone whose still using [NAME] jokes in 2019
Fish tanks and fiddlesticks, that was intense!
Seems like an odd hypothetical question to ask.
Thank you. This sub is the one place I feel understood
She has pretty hair.
i‚Äôd put forth that lots of people ACTIVELY DISLIKE dating and like being in relationships, so this wouldn‚Äôt help at all 
Lmao I'm sorry!
Oh, sorry
Unlucky, pricks.
Gotcha. I'll do a little Google-fu and see what comes up. Thanks anyway!
This also made me Smile, thank you
One can only hope this is the worst issue you ever have to deal with in life. Sheesh.
You are right. There's absolutely no group of liberals here that calls everyone right of [NAME] [NAME] every chance they get.
Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
[NAME] was such a fun weapon
I mean, it is, slowly but surely. It sucks. 
Lol. I was fan of that show and that line prior to becoming a fan of Arsenal and recently put the 2 together.
What a useless tool.
So many nice things here. Good vibes. Enjoy your cake day and weekend. ‚úå
It's literally essential that everyone stop what they are doing and watch this, the best video, as many times as possible and then some more times.
Im not going to swear
It's like...I knew where this was going and I still laughed.
those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful.
This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
better yet. cancel your subscription to Netflix and go for a walk. much better for you anyway.
Sorry, I would like your comment, but it's at 666. And I just can't bring myself to change that.
"[NAME] i love this ""no one can be THIS happy, what a horrible person he must be"""
I'm sorry. I meant numbers. Where can I see them.
He must simply be known as [NAME], all the greats are known by a single name.
But milk is beta food! Who wants that girly ass shit from a boob? My child will drink bone broth and the tears of broken women!!
She‚Äôs so hot. Also happy cake day
our enemy, the state 
I did notice it because it was widely reported in the media! Just as this would be!
OF COURSE IT WON FUCKIN PRETENTIOUS ASS FUCKING SLOW POINTLESS MOVIE OH BLACK AND WHITE WOWWWW
Every INTJ Girl I dated said they aren't interested in me because we are too much the same
What a rollercoaster
Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME].
That sounds frustrating!
Never worked on my babies. So disappointing
It's also about anyone else who feels down or attacked by misandrist social signals. Finding ways to counteract these signals and their effects is a worthwhile pursuit.
Thank you. Let‚Äôs not blame one parent only for the existence of a child, or the batshitness of one coparent. 
Wow, I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that at all. What a crazy situation! Poor woman!! 
Oh geez man... You posted this image to at least 600 subreddits.. Why And now made a new account for it...
Just another above average looking girl who works out for a year and gets a million followers for posting her ass. We live in a society
[NAME] no, these are horrid on anyone.
I love how someone put a laughing emoji on that.
horse meat is fucking peng i love it. why is it ok for a cow to be slaughtered for food but not a horse? ridiculous double standards
annoyed at most
My only regret will be posting this on my alt account.
No problem! Happy to help :)
my good woman, I'm not sure that you handled it poorly
this is not bad
Im sorry but I dont get the joke, can someone explain it to me?
Shootouts aren‚Äôt our strong suit. Happy to get out with a point though
Did you know it inspired a direct to dvd adaptation with the same name?
"""I shouldn't have done that, it's not the honorable way."""
That definitely hurt
I definitely get that vibe from this post. Or [NAME] was friends with them and didn‚Äôt get invited to the party lmao
Any that lands for us tbh lol
Damn that must feel great!
Yeah -- a woman who expects a guy to never even think about other women for the rest of his life is a special kind of delusional.
[RELIGION] Match all the way! I met the love of my life :-)
This is adorable I want an update
They all have these same moronic talking points that they memorized. It's hilarious. I hear them all the time
Okay perfect! I'll definitely have that conversation with him then. Thanks for the help! :)
Yes. (That's the back side of the Palace hotel.)
Thank you! And i understand that one too.
I've come to the conclusion that TMoR's Snoo needs to be more orange.
Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.
Thanks, posted there!
I love you for making this
"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
starting 2019 of with a banger, can't wait what else will happen this year 
You can say what you want about USM, but we love our baseball.
Thanks for explaining it! I‚Äôm not sure why my comment got downvoted. Without context, it makes no sense.
[NAME] I wish we had a free pass to say that üòπ Would make my days so much easier
I have the same issue. Except I'm a dude. Talking about my face. One likes me scruffy, the other baby smoothe
2013 was Dunk City, right? Because that was incredible 
An afternoon of Big Cat vs Vol Twitter will be fun
I hear ya man, it sucks that we live in a world where we have to worry about so much nonsense instead of just being ourselves. 
This didn‚Äôt age well
I love that place I actually went their for my prom pictures
Yeah, that makes sense, too. (Did it. Once. When I was like 16)
You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake.
Thank you for your comment, I didn't know Phoenix had a subreddit so now I'm subbed.
You gotta watch with subtitles IMO. The dubbed English version looks and sounds ridiculous.
Thats it I am out. This sub stinks.
I'm sorry man sounds bad
I'm sorry you had to go through that. Though I'm glad you're out of that toxic environment now.
Hell yeah it did!
Thank you, lightwaves. Very cool.
I‚Äôve never been in love, haha. So I wouldn‚Äôt know.. thank you for this comment :)
The article was about LEGAL delivery, you big dummy. I too love when people without knowledge of a situation respond like they know what‚Äôs what.
Spent time with them. Argue with them. Laugh with them. Cry with them. We all get lonely when we are old.
Harsh, but true
Good! We need him to serve bops so pop can win some more
stop making me cry man
If you ever need to talk to some one and just vent to just DM me.
Dude nsfw this damn
Thank you for the solid advice üëç I‚Äôve had about a year of creative highs so maybe my brain just needs a break
Sadly this story has died down why is he bringing it back up. Just let it die.
I signed up!! I hope your Mother has a wonderful birthday!!
I always suggest Laser Quest downtown, it's a blast!
Jack torrance can be nice
If you have bo toleramce you could feel it for a day
Dang if that was actually what happened that does kind of suck. Thanks op!
Bro. We‚Äôve been cursed since way before that.
Cheers, brother. What are you doing to meet women? 
That last bit is part of the embarrassment, actually.
I am sorry but I can feel a panic attack. Holy moly I would die instantly If I were him
They're a double edge sword. Not too heavy on the beauty, but they always immensely helped me to immerse.

Geez, we still got about an hour left lol
dude that stadium was lit as fuck ü§£ü§£ü§£ were about to embrace the tank like never before
That's the same thing 8 year olds use to try and get my items in video games. The guilt and shame strategy... Pathetic.
put on some real filthy porn before running errands, that'll leave the parents with having to answer really awkward questions 
Did a lousy job, my dishes are still dirty.
Nobody got time for that, Dont even like twitter
Thats too funny
Have a good one, mate. I wish you all the loves. Here, a potcoin for you.
Sadly it happens randomly and I wouldn't want to lie to someone for money if the thoughts didn't appear.
[NAME] looked so lost for 3 quarters. No pocket awareness. Terribly inaccurate. I hope this version of [NAME] is here to stay.
That's different lol.. And any positive, faint or not, is a positive!
Thanks for the insight. I guess I‚Äôm coming off a bit ignorant and maybe naive.
hey, that's me. Glad i'm done with the class, so much work
I'd love if Sony use [NAME] as [NAME] in a Venom movie. I want [NAME]
no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.
If he saw it as something regrettable and possibly embarrassing, and has grown, eh. We all have something embarrassing in our past.
Thanks. Some of the things just require a little tweaking so really I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be too hard.
Fucking love my pixel 2 ended up hating every Apple device I owned
This is not helpful to OP who is going through some unbelievable trauma.
I think this type of stuff is great fun too. However, my ex objects if the kids go back to her with too many scrapes and bruises. 
Thank [NAME] for the adult spammers on my susbscribed NSFW subreddits.
For some reason I wanted to be a bartender when I was 8. After hearing this story, makes me feel I missed out. 
Mental illness. Operation on 7 people in a manic state . Four of them died. All his money was gone and his rich friends abandoned him.
That's false
>zucchini Literally LOL! I'm trying not to wake my sleeping husband, but I can't stop laughing!
Wait this is what chill looks like? Some girl told me that I look dead amd I flinch at the slightest movement. You really call that chill?
Weird, FBI did an investigation and proved that never happened. White knights make me cringe.
Alot of friends and family make that or less. It's pretty crazy.
I explained exactly why they‚Äôre authoritarian. Businesses are literal plutocracies.
This is the single most wholesome thing I've seen on reddit. Proud.
I love Wayfair! Just started using them and am impressed. Sounds like UPS sucks. Enjoy your couches! Haha
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
I just worked 6 hrs today and already hate it lol work just sucks. I'm not sure how other people do it.
Good instincts to try to get move out of the road. Hope they are alright.
Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
I didn't have an umbrella and got wet but it's so damn humid still it's all stanky feeling outside.
"Weird how ive been ""attempted"" the same scam twice and im just a nobody.. Probably more or less amatur x'D"
Wow! Good for her! I‚Äôm so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
I wish I'd get invited to parties...
Was really hoping for something about free aim in this update. Can't see myself playing gun rush against auto aimers lol
Baby, You get all the credit with your excellent research!
You, I like you 
Unfriend this kid in all ways possible. Sucks for both of you, but this could be much worse. 
[NAME] supporters don‚Äôt see it as offensive.
Sorry man, I have no idea either! 
I don't live there just have family there.
Thank you! We all appreciate the kind words! üíì
[NAME], your uncle is not the hero you think he is.
False, if I'm close to the cart return I can't run and ride the cart back to the return. Lol
‚ÄúStart caring about Reddit downvotes‚Äù has to be the weirdest life advice I‚Äôve received in years.
She's so remarkably stupid.
> Thank you president [NAME] for providing us with meme material that will last a week! I think you mean 5 more years.
I had no idea but seeing this things make so much more sense...
LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.
Damn, this one sucks doubly so considering all the positive threads on here today.
...And what's impressive is she managed to sell two internets before she was so rudely interrupted...maybe your Land Lady should consider telemarketing. :P
So true, sometimes what‚Äôs obvious passes over our heads. Good post.
you still didn't answer the point....lol
Thank fuck they died... I mean rip, so sad üí≠üôè
This is just a stupid question. The answer is who cares? [NAME] is on an entirely different level from [NAME].
Me, it's too cute for words.
Oh man, okay yeah i was wrong, thank you for correcting me
Not pretty right now
Yes! And the one who embarrasses you by dancing and singing in the car while she's driving you and your friends home.
I heard this was because of a bill that happens to go in affect during the Government shutdown.
The cringe is just beautiful
I saw 25yr old with 3 kids and a house. How do u think I feel. I'm over 30 and still single.
[NAME] is going to love her!
Thank [NAME] for your mother and her googling skills! Now if you have kids you know who allowed and welcome to be around them and who not.
Yeah but you're not anymore I'm afraid.
Best of luck. Don't be afraid to come back if you want specific talking points if you get stuck. And take care!
But all-Korean teams don't always do the best in OWL/Contenders, look at Outlaws v. Seoul, etc... 
I promise you it would for most people. You're just spoiled with having the mountains 45 minutes away.
I‚Äôve got bad news for you about NFL locker rooms if you‚Äôre offended by homophobic slurs....
"Don't fight reactionary idiots in public sure sounds a lot like ""sit down and shut up"" to me"
General malaise is a favourite. I get a lot of general malaise.
It‚Äôs pretty embarrassing to see a grown man be taken down by a dog when the man outweighs the dog by a lot lmfao
Wow spongebob was right!
I hope you are getting your levels tested! You can do some damage to yourself if they're too high.
As someone who could totally eat three donuts in a row if I let myself, the amount of sugar this woman consumed still struck terror into my heart
Yup. You see more hands, have to learn more to be competitive.. etc
There has to be someone that loves you, you just may not see it right now. 
Thanks! I‚Äôll take that into account in the future!
also anxious that people will be angry or surprised or upset at me for me never telling people about this before
PARENTS: VACCINATE YOUR FUCKING KIDS OR THE NEXT NAP THEY TAKE WILL BE IN A COFFIN OMFG
I don‚Äôt know man I feel like this goal is just a combination of unluckiness
Religion is the biases for more hate; wars; discrimination; bigotry and poverty than any other entity in the world, with the exception of central banking.
Also, the phone is set to another language than the one being spoken, which is a bit weird.
I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it isüá´üá∑üò§
Oh come on, can you just enjoy the damn picture?
As a person who lives in NYC, I couldn't possibly agree more
I like to think they put that joke in because of the meme
Actually yes the left does need to earn my loyalty if they want me to keep voting for them
Yuuuuuuuuuup. It's horrible.
I'm fine, how about you?
It‚Äôs my favorite part of the whole week
He looked like he fell in love
Ya it would suck good luck too you and your family man üë®‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëçüëçü§ú
the act of using private companies as platforms to push indoctrination is no less vile than state run companies
Don't tell me what to do. I'm not going to argue with someone who goes around calling everything bro science.
Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
You dont need elected officials to have power when you have the people on your side.
Can we get a moment of silence for the passing of the video game boy?
How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s
So I'm being unsafe. I'll work on that, thanks.
I wish that I could do this and have someone genuinely care, and have it not be a therapist cause I can't afford it. 
You did a good choice :) i hope all goes well im proud of you !!!!! :)
Wow he is very gifted! I hope he continues to freeze more buffalos!

"The weird part of our ""rivalry"" is that some people bought into it."
Honestly? No. I just feel sad for you guys
Ok.... he can *call* it the State of the Union, but that doesn't mean it is.
Thanks. I didn't quite get it from the original. Appreciate the time.
Actually whoosh doesn't apply here because the criteria for whooshing is different.
Yeah you are second. Time to move on lol
And what a fuckton of karma it was. It‚Äôs fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.
When people bring up rape culture they mean stuff like this. Because yeah it‚Äôs been out and swept away and not raged over
This thread is one of worst things I've ever read
YOU'RE AWESOME, THANKS!
Nope, but is that a thing people who talk about digestive enzymes over lunch breaks should do? 
Sorry, might have been the wrong command. Just checked my uplay for it. It's /nodinputpad
"It just has to be ""unequivocal and unconditional"". ""Good faith"" was from the Advocate General opinion, not the Court."
You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me
Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
Though i think i preferred it when it was artistic and gritty i still love that series. Listening to the audiobook he took the voices from. highly recomended
[NAME] lol. I eat what I want.
Well to be fair to these idiots Family Guy constantly makes episodes complaining about their lack of Emmys.
Thanks. People need to calm down and give QCX a little time here.
[NAME] is pretty af
Thank you! They made me stay six days. It was not fun but it made me finally realize I need to work harder in therapy
Japan shouldn't have attacked the USA.
me, eating my sandwich, at 12:30 AM last night, after fasting all day.
That entire family is so embarrassing.
I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
yes, i know that people think of me as some strange freak because i never talk to anyone and act so awkward in social situations
Both me and my bf pee in the shower together hahahaha
Just stop.
[NAME] is worse.. [NAME] is really bad as well..
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
you're misinformed
#Garbage site for assholes
Oh damn it! I was just on my way to the post box
I can't wait for mom to slap his hand down
Nice work gang!
He is actually good now. No teddy but he was great last year before he got into shit
Lmao this article is almost a year old. Yawn.
Even while [NAME] in a America are discriminated against, they still have such warm hearts. [NAME] Bless them (my [NAME], and theirs)
This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
You are sexy af
Try reading up. Not going to play these stupid games with a butt hurt Meltzer fan boy.
"Dog thinking ""shit this guy is crazy, better get out"""
if I told 11 year old me that brussell sprouts are a top 5 vegetables, he'd have laughed in my face
I enjoyed speaking to [NAME]
depends on who im with lol. I became an Entp for a short while then went back to being an introvert.
What a fuckin n
That is so creepy and scary. Imagine if he really was a Dr, and the only one available in your hmo.
I like how he called his mom asking if she was trying to contact him just so he could tell her what‚Äôs wrong
I'm with you. I'd like one too.
She had it so good with [NAME] as his ex. Girlfriend was so freaking nice.
Turn in them. Who cares if they‚Äôre your cousins. They‚Äôre not three years old. They should know better.
Fund this man. Even if it doesn‚Äôt pan out it‚Äôs worth finding out.
I really hope she wasn‚Äôt trafficked. It‚Äôs more prevalent in the US than a lot of people realize :(
oliver and black canary is evergreen.. [NAME] is the most annoying character since season 3.. why would CW come up with that
One million points for Slytherin!
I'm so sorry that your partner doesn't understand that you no longer want to put hormones in your body.
What happened? I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this post. Her poor family. Those kids. üò¢
I bawled my eyes out, my best girl. 
To all of you who never had to take the SATs, consider yourselves lucky.
Happy's not a vehicle!!! He's my friend!!!
There is one teacher, and 3 paraprofessionals. She is overwhelmed, and I want to help.
Wish the teacher has spelled inventors correctly before testing the students.
You grew up in America. Your culture was teaching your children to think and fight for themselves.
I feel personally attacked. Every time one little thing happens, part of me just collapses inside.
Downvoted because I stated facts ok...
You are doing your kids such a grand favor! I wish I were raised like that.
I did marry [NAME]
Why'd I get downvoted? Am I not allowed to watch Spider-man?
I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.
> ...he was afraid for his life... I see he has mastered the magic incantation.
Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.
He knows he's not playing as well as he should be. By that logic [NAME] wants out so he should go too.
That‚Äôs it right there. Thanks for the simple reminder.
Future MILs love LOVE love getting on Reddit though.
I don't like [NAME] but I'd never wish this fate to any parent.
Wolf spiders are crazy too. Plus they carry all their babies on them!
Who cares, most people will be on their phone anyways.
This feels *so* cringeworthily thirsty after [NAME] ridiculous meet & greets recently.
Thank you destruct
Embrace the feels my friend. Glad you found happiness even if it is fleeting.
Why is the dude a douche? He didn't actually do anything, lol his political views are not relevant as he himself actually did nothing wrong.
No. Foreigners are not allowed to preach [RELIGION] to [NAME]. Maybe not explicitly . Also They restrict donations from abroad Not just people.
Who said anyone was white or black? Forget it, trumpie. You clowns don‚Äôt care about the truth. 
Thats the second quickest way I know of to burn through $1,000...The first being: R/WallStreetBets ü§£
"Yeah he was going like ""YOOOO"" and his boy was like yo chill man tf this aint no club keep yo voice down lmao"
Women are nice. Except when they murder you.
Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I think they're great much easier than my thoughts of trying to donate money instead of the contents.
Can't even do that anymore :(
2017's sky high fees proved that this tech fails on a large scale. It's a disappointing reality.
Serious on the vacation time, I haven't seen some government workers doing anything for weeks now!
Nope! But happy for you‚ù£Ô∏è
Sure you can, it‚Äôs called abortion, we‚Äôve done it literally millions of times
Yeah no.
Peeps poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!
[NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
Work on the pitching, that was a weakness of the team last season.
That‚Äôs beautiful
Let's do it (if done smartly by SK) NK wants to go the path of Vietnam in how they developed
OH [NAME] I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE!
Yeah fuck this shit, the dude isn't even doing anything noteworthy, it's just a man doing his job.
Hope they don't pull another [NAME] on [NAME]. Good to hear [NAME] added muscle and is healthy. Hopefully he and [NAME] can play all 16 this season
Lol. The majority of military jobs aren‚Äôt combat related.
Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. üòî
Ok, hope you are right
Not as excited anymore about having the most difficult second half in the NHL...
enjoy that vodka, [NAME]
No they don't.
[NAME] in the Lego movie? Get outta here
The judge wasn‚Äôt impartial as decided by the appeal court. The judge needs to be schooled.
> She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
I'm just glad everything came out okay.
I like your style.
Ah fuck.
_warm and fuzzy feelings..._ Damn it, I'm getting all sentimental again...
Thanks now I gotta go listen to golden earring
Dude, wtf is this?
Every time I think about how close we were to getting [NAME] it hurts a little bit more...
I like you [NAME] :)
Please don‚Äôt murder me
There's DOJ guidelines that he cannot be indicted.
Hahaha dude that was *so* well put
Can confirm, I have 2 (but be careful as you may still be allergic to their saliva)
JV for AD - i know its lopsided, but we need to swallow that pill.
Everyday, always, I am a hero inside my head
Yeah, not having a system that treats a kid that can't read as an emergency is a problem. 
This stressed me out
I'd say the pecans is the biggest mistake
I miss him so much during the NCAA tournament.
Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits.
I do but no one wants to play with me I at least try to play by my self but it gets really boring.
This is a good step. Refusing to vaccinate your kids should be considered child abuse.
That arena is so ugly I‚Äôd be scared too
I had my skin half ripped off thanks to a belt machine. Never got my arm close to the belts
Haha your mom lol üòéüòé. Having flashbacks of 4th grade rn
Glad to hear it. Love Rapid City.
Fucking awesome tournament to watch, well done WePlay, grats to Maggo. The constructed meta ain't that stale!
I'd prefer her as an actual character
I do this. Every. Single. Time.
don't know any [NAME], sorry
You must be fun at parties.
Hahaha I was gonna put one of those but I couldn‚Äôt remember what they were
All the signs, except his username, seemed legit. I also clicked. Now I just want to forget all about what I've just seen...
He's alright, Avatar, The Happening and After Earth were genuinely terrible films. 
Lol I even got called transphobic. Love to not be allowed to dislike Mother.
Yes, I filed for a protective order. Other than that, there is no happy ending with a narc.
Confirmed, word added to Oxford dictionary in 2022. Now to spread the word and get it into general circulation so that this can happen. [NAME].
As a computer science student but also a lifelong [NAME], the issues surrounding Amazon in Queens have left me substantially torn. 
Thanks. I desperately need to connect with other women.
"There's a bit of room between ""not loving sub-zero temperatures"" and ""never going outside."""
i don't usually 'wall of text' posts but i'm glad i made your post an exception. thank you, it brought tears to my eyes.
That's really awesome!
I refuse to watch this. Lifetime exploiting [NAME] gross behavior to sell 'entertainment'.
They look so good together *praying for Disney ending*
That‚Äôs how I read it in the sentence but my brain reads it as ‚Äúyeahno‚Äù. Lol
>just because I miss [NAME] and [NAME], who played them. You forgot to add the rest of that sentence 
"""every time she was in trouble I was there for her"" - the man who caused most of her troubles "
American scouts are weird. I've had mixed groups since I was a teen, and I've never saw the need for different groups for each sex
Glitter is awful for everything

Haha love it
I enjoyed hardcore mode much, much more than regular mode in BF4. More realistic
The worst!! I don‚Äôt get cramps so much but my back will kill me
Haha, this is hilarious.
The shipping container are my friends, damnit
I think a few guys on the team have said [NAME] just listens to country music lol.
Just for recreational use? Glad you are having a change of mind though
And I've no monkeys left.... Sorry man
Removed and warned. R1
Thanks for the warning üòâ
I actually laughed my ass off so hard i had tears. Well done creator!!
And we play for 6 dollars, this makes me so angry we need a big ass casino in that game
[NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch.
My friend on PS4 said that if you don‚Äôt stay to kill the bear, you can‚Äôt kill it.
The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage.
I'm afraid if I have a awful time or something like that I'm going to get worse..
Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
That‚Äôs my favorite way to introduce myself tbh
Yea we need more good news to give other people hope, enough hope to give them a helpfull push to pursue what they really want. 
My type of cheerleader. Those are some good looking guys
Thank you very much. Follow up question what is a suura?
Thank you for your advice! I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
Nice win! Good luck on your future tournaments!
[NAME] a bastard man
I think you're pretty neat, but I respect your distance
He's done nothing to earn trust either. He got ran out of Miami
yeeey [NAME], My purpose has been fulfilled Now I must go
great win leading into memphis. everyone contributed, awesome team basketball and defense throughout 
Why is sleeping with a coworker such a big problem for a news network? It‚Äôs not the military with a rank disparity or something
That is a great video
I‚Äôm still sorry you had to go through that. I‚Äôm sorry anybody has to experience fear on a daily basis.
Obviously he has not adhered to his promises, however what I noticed is this is basically the same message that [NAME] had.
They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
Seriously, someone out there has to love this dumpster fire TV show enough to edit some videos
How embarrassing.
Class topper meant something way different when I was growing up lol
"So your sticking by the term ""extremist"" for this massive chunk of the population."
their is a differences between losing and being embarrassed
It was a nice one too! GO AHEAD [NAME], SLAP THAT HAM!
I'm afraid you're completely correct. Sad, but true.
only take your shoes off if there is carpet. and carpet is nasty.
Well gen 3 was my first so it‚Äôs great!
What an ass. I almost downvoted this out of anger.
Have fun.
Idk what dumbass downvoted you, somatotypes are bullshit lol
Exactly. You make anything happen for the sake of your kids. Nothing should stand in your way.
I will say, this tanking season is a lot more enjoyable than [NAME] cause we don't see [NAME] looking confused on the sideline every game.
Define abuse. People can down vote as they see fit but it doesn't mean it has to ruin your day.
I'd love it, too. Might be that I've just gotten an idea for a post.
Thank you. As a father I found this hysterical. I'm legit laugh-crying rn
I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.
At least the repulsive sex scenes are helping me maintain my diet
Sorry to say OP but it seems his IQ is indeed higher than yours.
This video was close to being the most famous video in history
[NAME] was horribly inconsistent this year
I honestly couldn't care less if we lose or not. I'm over the moon about [NAME] and nothing could make me unhappy
That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.
Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It‚Äôs sad.
I love adamtots. He's a great comic creator
15 is too old to play playing fortnite smh
It's also why someone I know is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon. It's very grim and morbidly lucrative in the US.
Thank you. This is something I really needed to hear. Hugs, mama.
Gratzy-Gratzy. You have a brought a great joy to this old Italian stereotype.
Ever heard of the New Deal? Look it up, it was pretty cool.
thanks older generations :)
Boy where is you. We use to race on the parkway in highschool lmao.
Yeah I cannot either on mobile, same with enough internet. Thoroughly disappointing.
Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.
Why do you think many feminists are angry?
It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.
Thanks for the info
Happiness is not earned, it is a choice that can be made once your basic needs are met.
That‚Äôs a fuckin budgie. You gotta be a moron at birds to not know that. That‚Äôs like Bird Basics 101.
Okay, thank you!
I actually really like these, my little sister would be in love with these! 
The women-are-wonderful effect.
[NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
As much as I like [NAME], losing [NAME] still has to hurt. He‚Äôs just so damn lovable 
Looks like he's got the funk.
Hmm okay, maybe I was just arriving at threads too early or something before they got cleaned up...
Oh gosh dang it
Gone but not forgotten. You will be missed, you will be forever loved.
YOU WIN!
Pretty cool.
Very interesting!!!
He can‚Äôt do that! Shoot him, or something!
That's pretty subjective tbh. I loved [NAME] VA specially in the angry and intense scenes. [NAME] was pretty good too, but I prefer [NAME].
This makes me want Lancaster to be cannon! It‚Äôll probably never happen thoughüò•.
No problem, I hope that you are able to accomplish what you wish :)
my [NAME] this is just *yes*
I like Tom and Kato.
I need a thick 10 inches too, thank you. 
Actually that's the wrong guy. The guy you're thinking of is in prison now facing life. This guy sucks just as bad though..
It is a great line though!
It would feel amazing. Which would scare you. So you would crush it. Along with yourself.
That is so relatable! I used to be amazing at hearing whether a parent was coming upstairs.
Pretty sure it's a rubber toy made to look like one
then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible
Can‚Äôt see him doing well in the premier league tbh. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he ends up wishing he stayed at Dortmund.
The real bad beat.
You shut your mouth. shut it right now. *sobbing uncontrollably*
I believe the GM of Seattle would be known as ‚ÄúHis Royal bitch pigeoness‚Äù
No sure what‚Äôs going on here, but [NAME] was one of my absolute favorites growing up
That's an extremely ignorant thing to say
Appreciate the help!
I love the sense of humor on this sub. It gets me.
Yeah I love the shenanigans he gets up to. Shame he hasn't been able to get up to much recently though.
[NAME] this was hard to get through. Please crosspost to r/sadcringe
This has been reposted so many times the photo is degrading.
Tastes better? Or maybe totally worse I don‚Äôt have experience
All these soldiers taking a load of their feet... I feel ashamed for my homeland !!
I live in Orlando, where was this? lol
I came here for this. You and your fancy teeth filled with toxic PFAS can bite me!
‚ÄúOkay [NAME] you‚Äôre doing great I love you. Later can I have some pets‚Äù
Oh sweet! I'm a bit farther but go into the city all the time. I'm around 50 min by train.
It‚Äôs a circlejerk that‚Äôs so strong it could power a small country
Thank you for explaining:)
Such a cool pic! Really wish the moon was in the dead middle though üôÉüôÉ
Thanks for posting OP, much love to the [NAME] out there.
It was weird, but there were usually just 5/6 players at each scene at most, and the rest would be usually doing other stuff.
Thank you u/closeteverything69, very cool!

"It's funny cause you say socialists have an ""ignorance of economics"" while posting on an anarcho-capitalist sub :) I think you clearly fundamentally misunderstand socialism. "
Since their job is to keep us safe, I would argue that it is very important.
Sorry just seemed like you were trying to make it a [NAME] thing
Daaaaang I bet he had a headache after that
You are amazing. You really and truly are. I'm so proud of you. Hugs.
You / he must be doing an excellent job, then. I've never encountered one. 
Nice of you to jump in for no reason, very cool.
Still concluding I‚Äôm disingenuous despite getting your facts wrong. Big ego you‚Äôve got.
poor little dude! Glad he's okay. He and his brother have a story to tell now.
This isn't a sport from Holland it's from Frisia, the title is wrong
Finally something nice
I'm disappointed by him not bragging about his 99 level atheism.
I'm going to pretend this question was asked in all honesty, and upvote. Besides the answer below is great.
it's so cold today I nearly cried just from the temperature and wind I DONT LIKE IT
 that‚Äôs actually sad, feel bad for him :/
I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
That explains why the dude in the back reacts the way he does... thank you!
That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
Wow, a Walmart Truck Stop. I think that would be outstanding! They should do that everywhere, I mean they already have the land.
Disconcerting how much I see this guy‚Äôs trash propaganda on my reddit feed
Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness
As much as I‚Äôd love [NAME] to be gone, i know they never would 
Lol what boyfriend
Same here. Waiting for the doctor rn. Hope you're ok
That guy face was soul crushing
Sonic boom is funny as hell. I love the writing so much.
Definitely was a nonononoyes for me there lol, I'm a horrible person
That‚Äôs what we keep trying to tell TSCC!!! ;)
That was a perfectly crafted joke and I see nothing wrong here.
At least the ice didnt break
What does that even mean? What a uselessly vague statement.
You could weigh even more than 152 at 10% 6 ft tall! But yes, that is the goal physique for many gym rats. 
Mostly because of the hype. I love going out with my friends!
oh okay gotcha! i was really baffled at that lol
Go check out the survey recently posted on AskFeminists. There are a lot of [NAME] openly admitting it.
It didnt last long sadly
That sounds a little paranoid
The rhyme scheme is amazing
It‚Äôs disgusting
Alright. I‚Äôll do that. I just don‚Äôt want to fail the cdcs you know thank you.
Sorry pal but your just England‚Äôs b team
Betcha he just needed a new tube of that colour for his kit, & thought it'd be funny to mess with your heads. 
Oh cool. Did everything else that got listed not happen either?
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.
My nuts hurt watching that second part
Crisis centers are not only for battered women they are for abused women as well. From the looks of it, they are all abusing you. 
Ah ok. Thank you!
No, no the PTA has not disbanded!
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD CONGRATS!!!!
my mom caught be masturbating to dominatrix porn (i was bored of vanilla shit) LOL But porn addiction is bad because it can stop you from approaching women etc
Given the horses ass you lot made of the last one, I think it‚Äôs best to put this idea on the back burner.
His mind is free of anxiety he is now able to concentrate
You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
could be, I have a distant aunt that's like 6 foot (we're kashmiri-punjabi).
I'm supposed to be going to see [NAME] at the cinema tonight. Truely resenting this decision, want to watch [NAME] so bad
Not to mention that the full video is part of the kids PR campaign according to [NAME] idiot
I wish someone were there to scream this at me every day.
True, we take pink and black pills daily, even some stacies are conscious of world around them being a grim place.
Sorry, not sorry, but this seems wrong and extremely disrespectful.
"The real worst though is when she says, ""I love you more"" 100% seriously."
I think making fun of him will just piss him off.
Find a girl who loves you *and* your eye holes.
He said i am being rude to her
I call even my dog my love (in local language) as a way to be caring to others.
Thank you. I have never seen the word typed in that way before.
I wish non-BPD people understood the pain of a relationship ending like we do. It's crippling and lasts forever.
It's been 10 minutes, I'm still laughing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
time to stop concerning yourself with brexiteers and start worrying about what went so wrong in the EU before more countries decide to depart
Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
If it's used as an excuse to fuck the onchain throughput, it is.
You don't hand your baby to perfect strangers in public. You keep them close and mitigate exposure to the best of your ability.
No. I've been bashing it for its very noticable issues that have plagued it for 3 years that the cw wont fix.
Thanks alot!
i like turtles
I went to college in his hometown. He's a grouchy old man who cares a lot about politics
My favourite scene in the movie.
Man being unattractive in appearance has pretty much taken any joy out of my life
Man this sucks. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying life in a big house with lambs!
This dude live near me. All my highschool classmates are big fans of his and look up to him.
That‚Äôs bull crap call.
Going to get hard for everyone after brexit
Spa's Absolutely love a spa. A proper one with a variety of sauna/steam rooms etc. It helps that they're usually full of women too.
It was [NAME] I think? And I only remember because I was surprised and then disappointed.
"If that's true, then you can't call what I would have with option 1 ""omnipotence""."
I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick.
Haven‚Äôt forgotten, but let‚Äôs get his ridiculous defense up to par. 
OMG my [NAME] hates it too but she does it to me all the time
We're out of the environment, it's ok.
and op is NOT self deprecating
There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
Don‚Äôt let them get you down man. Nothing wrong with a cozy night at home by yourself.
You're not, because I don't either. But I can still search Twitter. You know what else I found? Your evidence was deleted.
I wish it were. It would be funny to imply that [NAME] won [NAME] shirt!
It's great having both [NAME] and [NAME]
Man, this just gets funnier even after seeing it for the 30th time in the last month! /s
It doesn't, it just resets back to 1 *before* adding in your upvote. You're not gaming the system lol
Understandable in this day and age of gaming.
I was trying to make a friend that was being a douche jealous by telling him I was having a 3 some. Accidentally messaged it to my father.
Next time something like this happens tell them it's illegal to pet a working service dog and they could be sent to jail for it
Yep. ~~(Also, I'm not interested in getting arrested so sorry.)~~
I know! It amazes me every day, but I'm SO, SO thankful for those lists.
I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
Literally nothing. Every single thing on my body is ugly. I'm not exaggerating or imagining things.
Or perhaps we should look at the bigger problem: mental healthcare in the United States.
>I want to believe that everyone deserves love They absolutely do! And he loves himself enough already! Too much, in fact.
Yeah i know, i'm just stating why it slipped my mind, i'm glad you brought it up. 
I just don't want to see them shame themselves, and actually show their worth and virtue instead of showing themsleves to be a walking sexual object
The 1st 5 minutes of this game will be key. Hope they come out with some passion. Go Oil
Disagree wholeheartedly. I'm actually amazed anyone can think this way.
Buddy rocket league fair? I‚Äôm play 2 but I play like champion 1 and just get shit teammates üò°
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize you were saying that, my bad . And yes that‚Äôs a great idea that would help develop him 
Thanks for explaining it to me! I did have an adaptor thing to connect to HDMI, I will double check tonight
Gaaahhh. That one would hurt.
Thanks for sharing.
Lol I need to see this movie again.
Rain and snow, the whitetail mountains would have looked so nice covered in snow
The only term I really use is ‚Äúsis‚Äù for effect, imo referring to a guy as ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù is a little weird to me 
Holy shit he hit him hard
He's given them a year and a new budget. Everyone knew this was going to happen.
Bottom right is the cutest
You've been muted. Usually awarded for extreme toxicity, don't worry though its temporary.
You can't be worse than [NAME], your hired!
Can't wait to see the corporate oligarchs that are *lucky* enough to *randomly* get picked.
honestly this made me smile like an idiot on the subway, thank you.
It dulls the pain
I'm seeing the error using Chrome both on MacOs Desktop and Android. I'm glad it seems to just be me though. Apologies for the snarkiness.
Lol nah i‚Äôm not playing your game dude. Have a good night
Huh? edit: /u/DanVsStu I have no idea what this show even is - you have the wrong account
At least we know they have good taste
She had so so so many great looks. I can‚Äôt remember them all now, but she hardly ever made a misstep in regards to fashion. 
You are so stunning! A very classic beauty.
[NAME] there are so,many. But my favorite are: Hold you in my arms ~ [NAME] Dont forget me ~ Way out west [NAME] ~ [NAME] 
We don't undervalue him, almost any and all experts thing he is just not worth his contract.
This world doesn't deserve baby sloths!
Looked like [NAME] for some reason
It‚Äôs a really depressing show. Kinda like Mad Men.
‚ÄúThrive has changed not just your life but mine as well.‚Äù üôÑ yeah, definitely a child‚Äôs sentence structure
You're just lonely, dude. Don't mix that feeling with love.
Ur a dumbass
I'm proud that this is the first response I see.
Or it's awesome! It looks so nice out with the sunshine and all the new snow.
The absolute worst!
Because sometimes the middle is still wrong
You forgot about Argentina, 30k people died here because of the USA
I'm sad that you are against abortion. Can I drop my unwanted baby off at your door ?
This is kinda sad
Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses. I lack the words to really describe it. I've never felt so detatched from my own humanity.
Then the school had a special assembly to honor this hero and everyone clapped.
Lmao, I remember [NAME] saying this was the best game he'd ever played and was debating whether he should switch from HS.
Well one of our leading candidates is [NAME] so it's not like we're killing it in our search either
It gives me hope as well!
This post is a waste of time and doesn't belong here.
Alexa play Sad!
this take can get the fuck out. that bulge is sacred
The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I‚Äôm so sorry.
No worries! But I figure the written recipe should be handy for some folks.
Love the homeless encampment in the photo.
To annoy you That's the real on reason
Thank you OP , I can finally look at a picture of [NAME] without vomiting. 
Predatory towing is getting ridiculous. I have up to date stickers for all the properties I maintain and have been towed twice. Fuck em.
Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say
Nothin worse that doin the smooth criminal to be able to piss in the toilet
I still like beer.
And losing to division rivals gives them the tie breaker, no? Very frustrating. 
Shut up 15 year-old
There are racist morons everywhere.
That‚Äôs not a very humble opinion at all.
Nice. Spotted it having a feed of quandong as well by the looks of it.
Nah, you did all right.
Being someone who has severe anxiety and in this predicament before, you need to do what‚Äôs best for YOU
For those wondering: that appears to be a sycamore. It's one of the biggest tree species in the eastern USA.
As a fellow browns fan, unfortunate enough to be born into a browns family and in ohio... Hello sharer of a lifetime of heartbreak.
[NAME] i will laugh so hard if [NAME] actually bombs AS5
On the other hand, I'm pretty sure the Phoenix VA is actively trying to kill me lol.
Could have been worse if a piece of metal exploded into him instead harmlessly on the beach
What tickles me is how much you seem to dislike [NAME], despite being exactly like him lol
I cant stand [NAME]
I'm so uncomfortable.
Crazy how quick people are to forget.
Otherwise it would be a terrible disservice to the NHL
Bee happy! ' v')
Fuck it, it's every man/woman for themselves in this fucked City. I've given up caring.
Yeah it‚Äôs fine. Some supplements contain Ashwagandha which affects the gaba receptors so be cautious if you‚Äôre already on gabapentin or a beta blocker
I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
I can see that! Let's say that I'm less enthused by that idea now than I was after Mania last year...
I am eternally grateful that youtube did not exist while I was doing all my weird shit growing grow.
Yah, I'm a bad girl. In fact I'm bad at everything.
Funny. I take mine out of the hair tie and leave it down or in a loose clip.
Thank you...
It's funny how BMI doesn't measure those things. My torque wrench doesn't measure alpha radiation either.
It's crazy, the first day with icy, snowy roads it's scary but within a few days, grip and visibility sound like fantasy
Pleasure!:)
They're absolutely relaxing in this 3rd quarter, 7 points in 5 minutes so far...
That‚Äôs depressing
Maybe one day but I am very cultured*
The fingertip save against [NAME] in the Champions League Final shootout is forever etched in my brain. What a legend.
It was a great AMA too
You don't even provide a verifiable example, why should I accept your evidence.
Where the f are you going to school that you are hearing such remarks semi regularly? That's horrible!
I wish AOC was old enough to run for president
Thanks!!!
Makes me want to go shit on the doorstep of 540 Hampshire Street (Good2go HQ)
No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
Genitals in general are just kinda creepy, fleshy bits.
As much as I don‚Äôt like his splits would have liked him on that contract that‚Äôs a huge miss for the dodgers imo.
Idk, the Teen Mom subs are bad for this too. Really bad. 
please stop pointing your fingers in my face
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen that many downvotes.
Ok, I guess I gotta show some commitment, thanks!
time flies so fast when you're 18. i didnt expect id turn 30 and still a virgin. hah
I want to go back in time and hug you as a child (after you got the lice treated tho).
I used it for a while. It made me way more sociable and generally happier, optimistic Less anxious and stuck up Until it didnt, so enjoy it while it lasts
I do this when rolling haha
I cant get a cat but derpy behavior makes me want one so bad
That [NAME] missed layup is haunting me right now.
I've played around pretty extensively with this mod in [NAME] mode with friends. I'd recommend it.
Thank you XD
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
This isn't a meme its a cry for help
Hahaha I wish I was that witty at the time, I think I was still in naive shock at the rudeness of people in retail. 
I just actually listed it for trade haha. I can‚Äôt use paypal unfortunately as I‚Äôm under 18
I repent. I repent. Oh [NAME] [NAME], I do repent.
And she will try so be careful op
Think this was an underrated signing. Dudes such a beast when he‚Äôs on, can go multiple innings.
You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.
Dr [NAME] is the best! :)
13 year old account, this guy is ancient. 
I'm so sorry. Hang in there.
Such dumbass,I think I'm going to take my dog somewhere else
And then you got a little vacation from work too! :D
105 strikeouts over 81 2/3 innings. that's good lol [NAME]
Where the fuck is that Kepner rocks person when we need them the most.
I stopped watching [NAME] the moment vie when they made the sub surface and I realised they were rewriting history. It's insulting.
[NAME] and Resident Evil Biohazard, great afternoon.
Oooh I haven't heard of that one. I'll look around.
I was actually coming here to add a comment about her! She‚Äôs so cute and talented!
Don't forget the fort camper.
... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair
ITS MAM!
I live in a valley so it's effectively earlier than that for me.
It's not uncommon for OTPs to not use their mics or stay out of chat all together because of all the flame they get.
Great shot, from experience very difficult. 
Damn rui lol. Serving looks.
I cannot sadly, good luck though.
I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY
Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are.
I work at an R1 university, with most of my team composed of CS/CE undergrad students. Yes, I've known many...
So proud our sub is leaking into facebook
Just be sure to take some condoms with you.
... with my stepmom. Haha. Erm.
Thank you for explaining it better than my rambling. I agree.
That‚Äôs pretty awesome :)
I post on the the Donald you think I give a fat flying fuck?
Galaxy brained hot take Your IQ must be near [NAME] levels of hyperinteligence
If this is true 2020 is done. We won't have control of the presidency or Congress for decades.
Omg this is repulsive
I gave up on the show over and over before I adopted 'just skip around'. Ended up finishing all of 3-6.
First season got a lot of attention. I didn‚Äôt like the second season as much
Nobody has been banned lol
Yeah you have great solidarity with evil reigimes.
Actually really like this one Edit: nice shoes too, v annoyed at resell prices üòî
Please. I can‚Äôt even with these comments.
Best email ever
My bad if I just leaked /u/keypuncher and /u/ibiteyou 's Christmas card photo...
Cute but I dont like where this is going
Thanks, but please use the stickied megathread for all discussion and submissions. Repost it over there.
I'm ashamed that while trying to figure out what TKE stands for all I can come up with is Tau Kappa Epsilon.
The joke is that people still do this, so it is humorous that you are implying it's a thing of the past.
Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed.
Yeah but who‚Äôs to blame when you are put into a seemingly meaningless game when all you care about is one rank. Bad system.
I liked it better when [NAME] was half naked
I don‚Äôt think so. The rest of her profile was completely serious. She had photos from art museums and discussed politics in her profile.
I blame [NAME].
‚ÄúI am so sorry! That was not my intention at all. My apologies‚Äù so charming. They do give you warning though
I can try. That sounds interesting. Its hard for me to not be interrupted at my house too. But ill definitely try.
If you bake em you're gonna have a bad time
So unsatisfying that it didn‚Äôt end with a pit maneuver.
They‚Äôve always been bad my guy
Thanks! I‚Äôm only traveling for a week So I will for sure have less than 30g.
May you find and skin the perpetrator. My apologies to your family. ‚ù§
No! but they seem awesome!
Truth Yeah keep living in your reality lol Delusional idiot
"Was the song ""New Light""? I'd love to see the vid you're talking about if you come across it"
poor [NAME]. Someone else on here called her [NAME] from Family Ties. üòÇüòÇ I legit feel for her.
Congratulations on securing your CF Future!!!
You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
Redditors can really come together in a time of dire need.
You make less than zero sense.
No,no, you are right we should murder everyone we hate other wise hateful people win. 
Best comment ever.
I'm not covering for anybody, trump included.
I don‚Äôt really mind pickles, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre warm and soggy and there‚Äôs 1000 of them.
Yeah whether or not an animal is cute is pretty subjective, I was just in a bad mood when I wrote the post honestly.
i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw
I love this! üá¶üá∫
They are a couple in love so what's your beef.
I'm...not going to let him see me cry.
up shut fuck the
So you ignored the part I was clearly responding to, though, and decided you needed to explain the other thing. That makes sense to you?
The woman types like she isn‚Äôt a native speaker of English. Which worries me immensely.
My parents died. I wish they were someplace warm that I could visit them with their grandchild, and they could visit too.
U would be right. Oh yeah yeah
Well keep planting more!!!
ah, if only i could hug a beautiful and understanding woman and cry all my depression around her neck.
I can‚Äôt wait!!!
My response would have been, If [NAME] sees me as unworthy, then I do believe that [NAME] would have more use for my tithings.
An admirable effort
I recently ate here and it changed my life. Get the steak sandwich with roasted peppers and goat cheese. You will not regret it.
Good idea, thanks
oh Ye crazy again for 2019 huh
Oh, man. The whole story telling methodology was well done, and well paced.
It was pretty cool seeing him play all the horrible games based off his childhood stardom on AVGN‚Äôs YouTube channel. Fucking [NAME].... Bane of my childhood.
This is why I love people posting pics in the LA sub, because I see perspectives of LA that I would never see otherwise. Love this pic
Thank you. Its only applicable if its not in the customer's favor and if they follow other stipulations.
Well, I say good luck to you !
Thanks for the tip, just got some FYH Caesar on sale, can‚Äôt wait to try it!
Discuss equality, be labeled troll. Good bye. I am so disappointed. In humanity.
Sorry to hear about that! Are you just under observation? Any anti-clotting drugs they're pushing?
Where‚Äôs the joke? I can‚Äôt even figure out why someone would laugh at this.
Konami?! They havent made a relevant or decent game since the 90s.
He probably banked on the inherent secrecy of the community and ignorance (on Belgian law) of his victims.
That ESPN intro made me emotional üò≠
Of course. It would mean you owe them an unspecified favor in the future. That would be horrible.
This one tilted concrete square in my neighborhood that I keep fucking tripping over.
Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
Please just tell me [NAME] is in the top four
I'll continue to be dumb for supporting a company I like. Thanks for your input poor.
This game is a pain in the ass. There are few things as infuriating as getting dicked by 3s all game. Flashbacks to the 2nd Orlando game.
"He didn't ""die"". The dude behind pink guy doesn't want to continue being pink guy"
Good looking calamari.
*Samsung Other Android phones don't have Bixby, that's Samsung's BS (and yeah, it's terrible. I have the button / feature completely disabled)
I didn't realize it was that common of a thing for guys to do xD
Same. I felt like I haven‚Äôt found the ‚Äúright‚Äù therapist. Hang in there and hug your little one tight!
I mean... this is some shit right here
with a locker room like this is looking to be, I don't think Ohio State is done losing games that they shouldn't
After dating 2 of them, I can say I fully agree.
Yeah I‚Äôm going to need to see more of him.üòç, thank you 
So, bloody stop feeding cattle, nothing even compares to the resource consumption (waste) of the animal industry.
[NAME] are the liars, we know.
I eat crayons I shit crayons
I mean, this very post is climate change denial related, which has zero to do with the second amendment, so I don't get your point 
Right? This pops up like atleast once a month, for months now. Dude needs serious therapy...
Democrips & Rebloodicans was my favorite.
Thanks for the info, I was thinking the same.
My DW made this realization. She is a smart one...and a keeper.
I don't like the zombey cookies.
Sir that is a popular opinion. I'm too afraid of what sort of trade will happen to want one.
No he didn't lol every ref gives that. He was looking for it but it's still a foul
Interesting situation. You're actually supporting a strong awesome woman, but everyone who sees you is just gonna think you're a misogynistic psycho.
I regret this post so hard so much debate and anger lol
I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
My parents just couldn't understand that pick
Every team is beatable just maybe not by us
I actually like the progression of the [NAME] story. I think he has a chance to have a fantastic arc between FC5 and New Dawn.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs up to you‚Äù Clearly it is not up to you, or you wouldn‚Äôt have had a flipping miscarriage! 
Yeah, it‚Äôs just a pointless invasive comment when it‚Äôs coming from a stranger. 
Yeah I'm a moderator there. I'll let you post anything there because I'm a nice mod.
She just missed her shot at a champagne douche.
Some girls will like you, some girls won't. The end.
But he's relieving pressure. Just count yourself lucky he doesn't cough when he farts.
De un tronco a otro. I hope they wake up!
Honestly I‚Äôve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
So sorry to hear about your abnormal growth. I'm now green with envy. Are there other celestial gods that can identify with existence?
You should have asked her out. It would have made her feel better after that and you might have scored a date.
Like I said, most loved and most hated for now. We'll all get over it eventually. 
I mean that‚Äôs a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don‚Äôt see how that belongs here.
True, the commonly affiliated ones are mostly just sheer ignorance or things like that.
You people are the one's who got me here! Thanks to everybody who helped me reach 80+K upvotes:)
"The true perk is ""knowing all the good local spots"""
I can hardly hear you over those goal posts moving! Ahhhh the facts! They hurt! They hurt so bad mama!
So glad she died
Yeah im sure the chinaman who made this in his tiny noodle house for one millionth of a yuan is super stoked about this.
Because I felt like it, just as you felt like announcing you basic grooming while trying to be insulting. üôÑüòèü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Pretty impressed that they have pork roll there tbh
Thank you. It is somewhat comforting to think this may be the real issue and not that she just doesn't want to with me anymore.
New flavour! I love it!
All the best. Safe travels.
Haha, I feel that
oh my [NAME] the hands... so small... but so powerful...
Exactly, you never know. Good luck for Monday!
I had hot dogs. They were delicious, lol!
I don‚Äôt know who [NAME] is and, at this point, I‚Äôm too afraid to ask.
I am also interested in this link!
I am happy with North Sydney, Milson's Point or Kirribilli and happy with the 19th too!
Wow great video. I love her.
One of the 7 dwarfs is called happy
Good to hear that! I‚Äôve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried
If you went through the campaign, idk what needs to be explained üòÇ 
Thanks, bud!
That's just... Wow. I would've called CPS on her.
I am sorry little one
As an [NAME] I just want you to know that I appreciate you.
Just cut it all of, you won‚Äôt look bad

Excellent as always
<3 It was hilarious, sorry I doubted you!
Hows it smell down there 9 points below the wild card spot. Ya fuckin pine cone

Fry a egg with that bad boy. And you got yourself a nice breakfast.
Oooh I see! Oh god yes, [NAME] is one of the best things about England. I also quite like [NAME], for my sins!
The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
I don‚Äôt think we want some sort of incest plot arising here
I dealt drugs like FIZZLE ROCKS to help my sick mom.
It's not like UK monetary policy massively diverges from the Euro
"LOL at one of [NAME] favorite activities being ""observing people""...including [NAME]! "
I set the house on fire and almost killed my entire family
As a [NAME], I would like to extend an apology to anyone freezing in the polar vortex. 
A tree is useful today and 20 years ago, these people aren't.
Cool! Tell me more about yourself---PM me if you're more comfortable.
.5x speed. Every moment I enjoy would last longer and any time I find myself in a pickle, I'll have more time to react appropriately.
Thanks a ton man. I definitely do overthink a lot and I‚Äôd serve myself well letting life come to me more often
That poor snek :‚Äô(
Watson is a great dog name! I think you just named my next dog!
Joke's on u, I already have small penis!
Ah okay, I see! Thanks for the clarification.
Doesn't even make sense. You don't say dollars 5 so why put the dollar sign in front
Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are.
Yes but iy also makes complete sense that morty woild want it gone too, so i hate how he instantly assumes it was rick
So I'm not ugly I'm hideous
Faceee, you see all those models, be it plus sized, underweight or fit, all have one thing in common , good facial features
He was off by 5 minutes, not impressed. 
That's true, but you see, one man can really make a difference. [NAME] I loved the movie
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP
Wow, I had a cousin named [NAME] who ordered corn. Very nice lady, she died 2 years ago. Miss her xoxo
[NAME] I HATE those.
> Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!
Yes what the fuck is going on here
That isn't in the rule.
As someone who is about to be 29 this is the realest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
And based on the film of [NAME] novel *Johnny Got His Gun*, both worth checking out.
Do you fucken mind
Lol I learned how to train on the app no joke
Unless wages for food service workers change you better keep tipping.
The scorpion one on the swing set looked so bad. I think I heard her back break/crack.
Thank. Regardless, the fact that you can stay at 1mg kpins is fantastic
removed the bit calling you a right winger. Sorry.
Second, you accuse everyone who didn't ignore you of being a Russian propaganda poster
I‚Äôm naming my dog Sebastian! So I can kinda relate ( lol, def not the same). Love the name though.
Oh you got me. Good one.
if your paraphilia is public facing at any point in your life I think it's reasonable to assert that there's something wrong
I feel that way about [NAME] antis saying [NAME] and [NAME] antis saying [NAME]. But I‚Äôm also terrible and laugh every time I see it.
I wish Florida was a thing for me... But I'm keeping toasty with a little liquor love in Erie, PA... 
Welcome home, sister (assuming from your username)! May [NAME] love always burn in your heart!
Thanks! I'll check it out! :)
lovely! the real grass and metal roses compliment each other.
Yeah that was my bad. I was just heated after that loss and was being an ass. My b
i am uncomfortable
I unfortunately can not afford a lawyer. Luckily the only thing that we shared is our daughter
I don't even know. Fyi I have this disorder that made me even antisocial day by day...
Yea the conversation went as expected and now I'm looking for a new job. Thanks to all for the help
you keep telling yourself that - now go back to sleep before you embarrass yourself even more
My face imitated the Pikachu meme for a long time...
unplanned pregnancy != rape Not commenting on the beings involved in the story up above, but seriously those two things are not equivalent
Crocodile tears.. üôÑüêä
Lightborn, [NAME] Demise, Look at a wall, Bait out the flashlight person, Slug. Wow, so hard.
People on reddit love trying to change the definition of words to suit their points
I‚Äôm not crying.. You‚Äôre crying!
I have a hunch that [NAME] is the mastermind of the whole operation.
This is the shitposting I love
Yes I'm trips fail like that nothing you can do about it but brush yourself off and try again tomorrow
Well he hasn‚Äôt dont anything good ever. So sorry I‚Äôm not very excited about this trade.
Someone who's done very little to earn your ire. Did I piss in your cornflakes?
Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox
Adjust grip, change how you aim, and don‚Äôt worry about it.
I wasn't trying to counter your whole argument by objecting to a particular bit I found particularly silly
I‚Äôll read that, thanks!
That‚Äôs not true at all. I play on xbox and you can‚Äôt Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.
Oh I will be independent. I don't need someone like that in my life.
That sounds awesome! Thanks for the reply!
You're delusional
I hate to break it to you but [NAME] ARENT signing here
You are correct. But sometimes you might have a plan or you have to improvise. I‚Äôm glad it worked.
You should come. You'd enjoy it.
I feel like that‚Äôs not the best spot for a beach
That was very interesting. Thanks for effort to write this up!
Kid looks like he's about to cry
[NAME] lines especially. They're all so good because originally [NAME] was going to play that character.
the older i get the more it hurts
Cause emotions are difficult and people fear rejection
Searching is fun, and finding and learning all the spawns is satisfying.
[NAME] is the best character in cinematic history
RAIN was amazing Strange seeing [NAME] and [NAME] looking so much younger
The sad part is that we are not trying to tank
Spurs gonna get two in a row over us. Embarrassing
Keep fighting the good fight
"LOL top right one says ""It's MY birthday"""
If I get another dog imma name it after a [NAME] song SO FUCKING CUUUUTE
Where did people get this? It‚Äôs hilariously wrong.
Thank you for these advices can't wait to make them to the test ;)
The ruling class doesn't care. Their only goal is to plunder and loot the country for their own financial gain.
Right, we don't know for certain. It was just what I've heard. We'll have to wait until we can test it.
She really does and She really isn't! She's an old, tired ass, busted up, con artist hoe!
‚Äú‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt try it, [NAME]. I have the (moral) high ground!‚Äù 
Sorry its such a long post guys
You‚Äôre right, I was thinking of AiG or the Discovery Institute. 
Removed, stop trolling.
Wow, the cropping on this shitpost is as bad as it gets.
My girl [NAME]. Love that our names are the same bless
True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
Oof, yeah sorry my dude, it came across as pro-wall to me. Probably what happened with others as well.
Both consenting adults so nope not creepy
I don't think you should expect solid logic out of someone who believes [NAME] exists.
...to win the popular vote, which she easily did.
I feel you. It's weird that we don't see [NAME] or [NAME] in the promotional stuff though.
The Remini series. I love it. Horrifying and karma and righteous indignation.
great reference my friend
Yep - I was meaning for that to be rhetorical. And thanks, I'm looking out for numero uno!!!
as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad...
What the fuck who likes cold
Now that is an original Idea!!!
Nothing happens. However, I'm glad that ICOs have ceased to appear. 
> spending money I think you meant earning. Or they actually spent the money on the way home lol.
I miss being practically jello as a kid
Palace please don‚Äôt fucking bottle this
Considering the fact that I don't consider jealousy or envy useful, you are dead wrong. It might be other people but not me.
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
I'm so triggered!!!!!!! Please stop you are hurting us with your comments!?!?!?!?!?
mmmmm.... love me some kapusta with some bacon bits
That was a hell of a tip, that happens
Damn, good luck dude hope it goes well.
Old Firm game also on the same day. Media won't care about the rugby.
You can see the regret in the eyes
[NAME] Just Stop trying you idiot
The human species is more intelligent and sentient than any other animal species that's why.
Mine used to tell ‚Äûyou complain too much‚Äú. I was also angry when I was with him. I‚Äòm not like that.
If packaging sound policy with Hindutva is the only field booming especially in the coming chaos we‚Äôll be set.
They should prank their customers by having someone act out being given a colombian neck tie while getting a shave.
Eventually sure. But the question really lacked the maybe later option lol
The dad is like ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY Jokes aside, good on the dad and the 2nd pissed off dude Tryin to make a change :-
there's no ventilation shafts in the dumb things, block the exits and make a bonfire.
I fucking change my mind, something wonderful has happened! Please don't make me go dead, tomorrow.
Ahem...of the savoury kind.
Hey look It's a Bernout from Potomac! Lol
This is great! [NAME] the legend
Ya got a good life... *ya got a good life...*
That does make sense. Thanks.
Feeling better now?
i managed to craft that super early in the game and i was so disappointed that i basically could not get drunk
And the guy getting out of the front car acting like the car doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs trying to back up, unbelievable 
But [NAME] is fine
Being a [NAME] is no different from being a [NAME]. Both have caused genocides. I hate how our society only focuses on one though!
Can this guy just land himself in jail already so we don't have to hear about him anymore
Sorry for late reply Rosetta is an actual name, it is different than Noctis, Rosetta doesn't hit you like a cricket bat when you hear it.
Pokemon Go has kind of helped me with depression, tbh. 
Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
i don't think we really need to sign anybody to replace [NAME] assuming that pulls through, we can go small ball with [NAME] at the 4 or [NAME]
I'd love to hear a man explain why men do this
I applaud both of you for taking whatever action you can to make this succeed. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt offer any advice. Good luck.
I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.
Hell yeah buddy things are looking up.
Oh my goodness it's like a happy little cloud! What breed is it? Either way, omg enjoy petting that super soft puppy coat for me! 
I had this one! he was a precious little angel and I loved him.
I might be stupid but I thought [NAME] wore #16?
Thanks for the sauce boss
Isn‚Äôt banning people for their point of view against the whole fucking concept
I try my damndest. Hard to be sad these days when I got this guy with me
Sweeter than ever.
[NAME] type awkwardness that some thots go nuts for.
I didn't mean for that to sound racist I just mean those [NAME] in the article
That is one cute baby. I don‚Äôt think all babies are cute either. But this is a really cute baby.
Oh sorry, i thought you were having a dig at him lol. 
DoorDash will refund you if you didn‚Äôt receive it. Just contact their support.
Hurt his ankle but he‚Äôs okay apparently
Like and smash that subscribe button, I'll see you in the next video for my best v-bucks giveaway yet
I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
love that they're giving Spicy P a chance
Put away the screen and go outside. You'll feel much better.
You got down voted.. but you're absolutely right. I am now looking into one. Sweet.
Ahem. Second best NA
Good luck!
I once looked for my phone with my phone flash light
Thanks man. You too
You‚Äôre hardly qualified to talk.
Which is weird because it also looks like dog treats
It‚Äôs more of a vibe tbh I love playboi carti as much as I love [NAME]
And someone downvoted you for that smh
Sadly I had to scroll through the story to read this
Nope, but I'm sure it was mostly sales, you can lose a lot of clients if they lose the salesperson they have a relationship with.
They look pretty great tbh stache and all
Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
You're ugly
This is something I try to do every day and it makes me feel so at peace
I dont like my rights being restricted on the grounds of race. That is the issue.
I‚Äôve been banned twice there so I unsubscribed and joined this sub. This sub IS SO MUCH BETTER!
This is just so beautiful, man! 
The god awful CGI is honestly entertainment enough!
I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
Not an RFA my dude
They sound amazing :)
*and, sorry for the spelling mistake
Really wish we had got something like this!
Wayakum, [NAME] make it easy for you inshAllah. Feel free to PM me if you or your brother have any questions. Would love to help out.
congrats. i'm broken rn but if I wasn't I'd be happy for you
Keep going... üòèüòèüòèüòè
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
Apologies, sir
"Its actually ""[NAME]"" , not ""[NAME]"".. Sounds like a drunk to me. Glad to hear nothing horrible happened "
[NAME] is honestly really badass and he has a great design I hope they give him something good to do in 11
I hate when that happens.
Looks sick actually.
"They seem to have very ""sick"" laws in Saudi Arabia. Where women don't have any protection from government against their perpetrators."
that tease tonight lowered my hopes
biological gender isn't real. it's biological sex. do some research
I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
That‚Äôs the face of trying your best not to smile at a bad pun.
Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(
The phone calls in the first 10 minutes are absolutely damning.
no one loves me
Calling a 40k salary a humblebrag is still pretty funny in a self-deprecating way.
At least you have some girl to talk with at work.
I mean, he is a terrible president. 
What about [NAME]? [NAME] I hate her.
You're not retarded. It's a natural reaction to a lousy upbringing. Love your username BTW.
My comment wasn't aimed at you... try to relax
Ugh. Nice season from him, hoping he can build on it next year and play a bigger role at the world juniors.
We did it chief
Wow dude get a life and stop digging through my comments trying to pick a fight like a belligerent moron.
The first comment wasn't but when you not wanted you should just fuck off
U damn clown, she prolly felt so embarrassed and you‚Äôre just like meh
disappointing click of the day
If you are really so dead set against shoveling sidewalks, perhaps you should move to a warmer climate. 
If money's not a problem for you and you badly need to get braces then go for it, the sooner the faster your teeth can get adjusted.
"Innovation means ""I pridefully made this"" in China."
Yeah, I actually like the combination of the two styles of names thought. Love the LAFC and the LA Galaxy...lol
How terrible. Imagine waiting this long only to die the day before release? I always get that minor anxiety before a highly anticipated album!!
I second disagreeing that they are awesome.
Wow!!!
Looks great but am I the only one who can't hear anything?
Because the universe is dumb and not fair, but we can make it less dumb
Not practicing with the team, seems like a bad sign for playing today. 
I fucking love that you actually educated me a little about punk. Thanks for the suggestions, I'll definetly listen to them.
Not the right sub, I'm afraid.
Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him.
*[NAME] (hopefully) wins roast
you too! And I'm glad to hear you support your daughters rock/fandom love:)
I've not- I'll have to put it on my watchlist.
this makes me miss my girflriend
I bet you're not the only one. That space is kinda safe... go be slightly challenging. ;)
I was almost certain it was gonna be [NAME]
Lol for some reason this made me snort hard. Thank you.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt like my friend‚Äôs opinion either
[NAME] and [NAME] made their own beds with their own actions. But I agree with this too .
It's super funny üòÇ
That‚Äôs blasphemous üò©
[NAME] I hate this man
I think it's a r/fuckyoukaren joke
Well, never thought I'd be here, but here I am, someone who passionately hates the Florida Panthers 
And why isn‚Äôt it ranked average, Bayern are second most average but ranked 4th for most supported, cmon now they just had less games....
Uh, no. Not even remotely.
lmao i love this!
this is good. well done.
That's really interesting.
I didn't even think about counselors or talking to my obgyn. That's a great idea! I really appreciate the advice and encouragement :)
Yeah man, fuck the man. Can‚Äôt have people getting free stuff or have any creative marketing ideas.
I love how you worded this comment. It's like a proverb.
*snerk* People like this kill me. Idiots.
I love it. I love those melts they do that are croissants inside out and toasted
Well I did have one balanced meal...before a few alcoholic beverages.
Yup, already blocked his number, he was never supportive 
He's funny for sure... lol!
No kids, I have a broken oven. When my marriage fell apart that was a blessing.
Sorry to say it, but you will have to do that for now It sucks 
the fuck is wrong with this guy
"I'm irritated by the upside down ""Anti Crease"" bit more than anything. "
You seem fun.
And I barely said anything üòÇüòÇ
I'm so happy to hear you've recovered. Can I ask: are you able to maintain a healthy, stable romantic relationship?
I‚Äôd pass unless he cost nothing of significance.
It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
Politics in the KRG are some of the dumbest and most petty of the Middle East.
Yeah because a country can't multitask. Go pedal your propaganda elsewhere
Fuck is exactly what she's good for
I know it‚Äôs out of control!
Yeah i checked her teeth out and they are okay. I was worried about that as well
Oh yeah! He was great for us. 0.69 ERA in 24 G with 10.7 K/9. I forgot about him.
Imagine being that much of a useless parasite
Lmaoooo alright sure you did hardo.
I did too. A shame, because it looks to be a good movie otherwise.
Here‚Äôs a little update lol so far I‚Äôve had 3 matches today and all of them were ‚Äúcam models‚Äù lmfao
For some reason I'm imagining a hauty, French snorting laugh.
I will, eventually. Thank you for the kind words.
I agree, I love acdc, I just don't love the comments on their songs cause so many of them are dumb lmao
Lol this fan base has the memory of a goldfish.
This gives me anxiety and heartburn just looking at it!
It's the same with librarians. Out someplace, see someone with a confused look, and that autopilot kicks in. 
hell yeah my brother
I‚Äôm about to have a heart attack tonight
There is no quick fix to controlling it better. For pwBPD it tends to require a lot of therapy, often DBT.
Wasn't hurtful at all. It felt comforting to me reading it. We're all good.
I would never tell anyone stick is better than pad, but speaking personally, it's way more fun
Arguing a player is the GOAT among every position is just a dumb argument to even begin with when it comes to football.
Heard Sale players yelling at the refs and nothing has come of it, seems odd to suddenly have an issue with it
Play dumb all you want, you know what that has to do with it.
> If everyone is put on the same level, where‚Äôs the competition? That's not what communism is..
I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.
Well then outlive your enemy, get pass your old self that is the enemy and you can outlive the enemy
Guys have been asking this throughout history. Trying to get laid without commitment is not okay. Marriage is important and so is the paperwork.
Yes! Wonder how tall the girls will end up üòÇ
There is nothing worth saying about that insipid shaving cream ad. I haven't seen it and nothing will convince me to change that.
[NAME] that bottom picture. the brows mixed with the hair terrify me üò∞
Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
No kidding. That was extremely disappointing.
A surprise to no one. Absolute stud.
Ditto. I never pay attention to who‚Äôs posting comments I disagree with. What difference does it make?
Def not nypd lmao, but u hear you 
It seemed weird to me as well. It's just 10mcg of cyanocobalamin with some fillers like corn starch and celulose.
A sad amount of time was spent making this.
No, instant transmission is only to places you've been and people you know
Dude, she had just lost her baby, too. 
that looks like a nightmare.
No, but a cast member did talk to him after his yelling. 
When's he due? (Sorry, couldn't resist)
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
Females would be pressured the other way obviously
I meant one sided comment. My bad
Felt like yesterday when they got married in that barn/bar/bistro. Truly the halcyon days.
I read that as [NAME]. Lol
Whoever is breeding and seeking out these inbred animals is vile.
If the kid knew what she had on her mind, he's been corrupted way too young..
I was afraid of that .
gorgeous pic!
That is embarrassing, but at least they know you're not lying about the cause! 
She‚Äôs actually crazy
I miss [NAME]
Lol it's not a bad dance, what's cringe worthy is people getting so upset over a video game 
Some graffiti can turn that really bad
Hahaha years of being a nets fan makes me only look for reasons we wont win.
I hope. Sirens got me excited
FYI your boyfriends fucking her too.
The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
No, YOU‚ÄôRE crying!!!!
You also have the option of making it quite unique. Would be a delight to see if you got it!
Ah, that sounds frustrating! Thanks for sharing. I think I might steer clear of the teeth thing. 
It sounds like you‚Äôre the one who is afraid of the internet. Relax, bud. You‚Äôre on r/cringe 
It's almost like the whole rationalist thing was started by an overconfident person.
This is as cool as it was burgers and fries and started the Omnibus to collect the first few pages were just so much to unpack there...
Lol ik it's just I wanted people to figure it out and not the bot to ruin it.
< video does a good job explaining push/pull.
Cake! Happy days!
This almost makes me ashamed to be Irish. As we say here, ‚ÄúScarlet for your ma for having you!‚Äù
>!Cosplayer Bystander!<: I always knew he was a little bitch.
I recommend reading it. What an odd duck/rabbit.
it sounds like a huge pain in the ass to use compared to current systems in place though.
Your welcome.
[NAME] dammit I love wrestling
Oh my gosh! That light house!! Its terrifying!!
It is pretty disappointing when you can't pet a service dog that's cute but the rule has to be followed.
Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
"""We're sorry, all circuits are busy now due [NAME] lost keys, try your call again"""
aw thank you, I want to get rid of some of my extra things and eat food with less packaging
Very well said, thanks and couldn't agree more!
Cadbury is better than both of these, however they‚Äôre still solid choices.
Nope, not my department.
The Broadway store was popular too. I get that it's regulated now but it's a shame.
Lol no.
Thanks guys for the explanation, didn't know that!!
Bless you this post made me cry
Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
Every point you make is proven wrong lol. Just stop.
Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
Aghh bacon is actually the worst. The smell of it is soo disgusting you can smell the dirtiness
Classic Trap game... I'm nervous. Hope our boys aren't hungover.
"60 young men standing around... ""Look out that old native dude is coming right at us... DEFENSIVE POSITIONS SHIELDS UP!"""
I feel bad for house slaves, even if it's in their understandable self-interest. 
I love lions. Wouldn't want one in my house though. Might scare the dog. Same thing with children for me!
This was the scene that hooked me on the show.
You‚Äôre looking at hard time mate
Lmao compelling argument bud
Yeah I mentioned this route and how we won because the other teams kept wasting chances.
It is a long panel but very insightful - skip the intro pleasantries if you want, but you will have seen enough by the 30 minute mark 
Love when this happens. Thank you, oh wise one.
Thank you. I‚Äôve been doing more research about today, there‚Äôs definitely a lot to consider.
He‚Äôs a great guy? Calm down lol
Fingerprints not [NAME] or [NAME] red is [NAME] don‚Äôt just make things up now that is sad !
And they sneak the bit about reckless driving and speeding in at the end as making one a prohibited person. This is absurd.
lol out loud
Seahawks themselves are insufferable, so I would prefer a Dallas win. If only they both could somehow lose simultaneously...
Thank you for your validation. *Kowtows and give thanks the [NAME] way.*
Not actually cheating if the system is set up that way. Take it up with your Government.
Yeah they are! I didn't realize that, it must be the case. Thanks!
I‚Äôm just glad to finally see something truly cringy in a while
I know üò¢ it‚Äôs one of my life‚Äôs goals to see a moose in real life despite how terrified I will be lol!!
Not my proudest fap
But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad.
And this is actually one of the nicer flats you can get in Boness too!
I love it! A smile from a stranger has really turned my day around, so I always hope I can possibly do the same! 
I‚Äôm not crying... I‚Äôm just cutting onions... I-I‚Äôm making lasagna..
Wow, this is bizarre. Well, I agree too. A wealth tax is exactly what we need.
Funny enough, not all [NAME] are celebrities.
What a weird thing to say.
That's amazing! Did you have a zoom on the drone, or is the post effect?
And file a report if she doesnt cancel it when i confront her. Thanks for the advice though it‚Äôs well appreciated
There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.
Dice LA also has Dice Sweden employees on the team but we are wasting our time pointing it out.
I think I should say that I am a student and have no income.
Yes. Combined.
Cut rent control, then increase own housing allowance. Because fuck everybody else, am I right?
i freaking love five below! Wait no nevermind
I'm still insisting he is not her dad...
Yep, and because you do, you‚Äôre going on the highway to hell
[NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing.
Then it was effectively them pissing on your territory. Same with the bed. They don‚Äôt get to pass the threshold again!
Lack of content, which led to shipping wars, which destroyed everybody‚Äôs minds, which created this.
What a good pupper!
This helped me when I was in my worst mental state. I'm glad
Nice work. I really want the full scene in this format.
What makes BDS anti-Semitic, as opposed to just anti-Israel? I see the two frequently conflated, which I think is a mistake.
I found an understanding of [NAME] degrees of belief and updated probability extremely clarifying
Thank you!!! /s
i love this i am big fun of cross over and Lore Skin
No I mean those long winded nonsensical blabbering. Like the one with 300 confirmed kills, gorilla warfare. It is usually just to troll or annoy.
Ahhh makes sense. They were being sarcastic but it went over my head haha. Thank you.
Yes, yes you did
I‚Äôve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can‚Äôt imagine the pain of this
Pins are given out? My store hordes that shit like there‚Äôs a coming apocalypse and pins are the only thing that will save them.
I'm ashamed it took me a while to get it
I miss [NAME]
Rumor says he failed the medical. Probably false but this is Arsenal anything can happen.
Yep, lack of proper coaching yet again. Sucks we missed out on [NAME]. 
Self defense should be, and this man sexually assaulted this woman.
This is one of my favorite of [NAME] songs although all of them are really good. Either beautiful of funny all of them
The fact this isn't a [NAME] Attorney at Law Gif about this makes me kinda sad.
And yet you're still not making me regret being a TV hodad when that was on and so missing it.
Whoops! My mistake
These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
I see BOTW and now I'm waiting for a group of grown men to watch shitty old movies.
Don't be coy were talking about the active ingredients here not the plant itself.
Wonderful sculptures. Love the expression of the Scottish mythology behind them.
so proud of you!
Over in r/texas we are coming up with slogans to ecourage people to switch to renewable.
Honestly acid is fun with 4-6 friends and shrooms is fun with 1-3 friends
Same boat, sank pretty hard at the worst time.
If I told you, that would defeat the purpose of censoring. Let's just say it's clearly libellous.
She looks so FIERCE. I love it.
And caressing your hair.. I‚Äôm not even a woman and that makes me shudder thinking about that
I've found multiple people who fulfill a specific need of mine, and I love them all!
It doesn't have to only effect one for it to affect women.
Thank you!
Being a woman is not an excuse, you do not represent all women. Thank the lord.
you too good sir
> extreme poverty is re emerging in the west. lol
I couldn't reply to the message I got the other day
Why is everyone smoking out of straws and shit?!
I prefer to use a welding torch. I like the ozone and ultraviolet clean feeling and smells. Never have to wash the sheets either.
I love chicken
You‚Äôre right. Thank you for the context and information.
Damn ive been hard on brown but he's been looking like 15-16 [NAME] this game
There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for.
Gr√∏h. Fast great moves and becomes insane during soul charge
If you‚Äôre going to be willfully ignorant, we have nothing to discuss. Good luck clinging desperately to these antiquated ideas.
I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
2016 was also the worst year of my life
I'm excited, we're supposed to be getting ours this year. Finally. 
I wholeheartedly agree with you. I suspect that children this age don't quite understand this
I love it
I‚Äôm very sorry for the loss of your friend.
You have social anxiety go see a doctor
25000 likes wow! I got max. 30-35 likes.
Depends on what you want to do, but I'd buy This
unrealistic, the little fuck didn't taunt post-kill
And other hilarious lies you can tell yourself...
I feel a connection to this woman
That‚Äôs my point.
Seems fun, wonder how she would have ended up if the ca er was not there
this makes liberals look like spoiled house cats, it's embarrassing honestly.
I believe you copied and paste from somewhere or previous answer. We are definitely not talking about the same thing. Hope you get better man. Cheers.
holy crap that's messed up.
Good bot.
Thanks for doing the job well. :)
Something would go terribly wrong for [NAME] causing him to have to leave. It‚Äôs how his ability works.
Thank you, next
Holy fuck youre pathetic. I hope you have insurance. Therapy is expensive I hear
You're giving her too much credit.
Cute. I hope it makes you feel empowered.
Oh man, I love [NAME]. She's so consistently good. 
Also that college is overrated because they are or know a welder or plumber that's makes 200k .
[NAME] - OT3 in my team without me... [NAME] - Sometimes bad things just happen...
Heh, [NAME] costume love is being triggered.
We sincerely hope not.
Except you didn't and it's still false.
It's the number one reason I refuse to exercise.
Are you replying to something in particular, because what you stated is so obvious I would hope it need not be said on a science thread.
This post is so true Clothes these days are so bland
He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy.
I mean this in the least creepy way possible, tell me how it works out NO DETAILS PLEASE GOD NO
Are you my coworker? I swear my boss will randomly scream and its embarrassing.
Obviously, there's only a few inches, but I could never really see any improvement. i thought it would be a good supplement option for you.
And he doesn‚Äôt even stop. It‚Äôs your work truck, man! They‚Äôre going to find out regardless. 
Thanks, I reached out
i prefer this
Sorry, but getting shot at causes an almost instinctive natural reflexive reaction to shoot back. I guess I'm just weird like that. 
I couldn‚Äôt believe that. I‚Äôve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN‚Äô?
I don‚Äôt even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
Dont worry guys, its all sanitary. He hit the wrench with some WD40 before he started.
Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child.
I don‚Äôt believe the mislintat or the big joke parts
Australia... Nooooooooooo!
I really hope web design follows in fashion‚Äôs footsteps and starts emulating 90‚Äôs-00‚Äôs webpages. Such a nostalgic feeling seeing that site.
[NAME] a fantastic word poet
Uncle [NAME] doesn‚Äôt deserve this
It's amazing how people will tell you not to go for something, but then are the same ones who can't go 2 minutes without it.
depending on his age there might still be hope. brain development supposedly stops around age 25 so if he gets ample simulation and nutrients perhaps there can be hope
THIS IS THE JOKE
I ... I like you
thanks for the warning :)
Same here, i hope my upcoming trip is gonna kill me
Slathered in blue cheese. [NAME] is so jealous.
Because we didnt have two top 5 players on the team so the bench needed to be great
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
Thanks for the response.
Or the long con. My Dad guilted me into taking care of my Grandmother for her.
Nice, congrats!
31/M/I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm blind.
Sorry, but this one is funny. Wake up at 3am jabbing with a needle, patient satisfaction survey, what could possibly go wrong??
Im color blind, i usually see blue as purple and red as green soo...
It‚Äôs not so much the heat, it‚Äôs the humidity that‚Äôll kill you.
wow octane is pure garbage lmao
Poor [NAME]. I like her. I wish they'd show what's going on with her.
Was feeling victimized that it was very cold in my apartment. Windows are drafty af!!!!
Quit being a panzy and just have a laugh
She gets genuinely emotional sometimes too. I love it. So refreshing
Super helpful. Thanks!
This is yummy. I hope mods dont remove it
Technically it‚Äôs the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
Start taking psyllium husk and literally every poop will be your best.
There are worse things!!!:
Ty going through a lot right now and this made me smile.
That actually looks super, super cool.
Shamelessly stolen from Three Flavours Cornetto Posting
No, this is not polyamory. It's assholery.
"simply reply ""no."" sometimes youve gotta be rude."
I made a severe and continuous lapse of judgement....
Y so serious
Aaaand everybody got diarrhea. Thanks dummy
My toes hurt watching this
This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it
No, their reaction was just as bad.
Mmmm traveling for work often isn't exactly the most desirable situation. It can be exhausting.
Why nothing will change at all ... lol
I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
Watching Revenge sometimes makes me cry, thinking back to when I tried to memorize that song, and listened to it over and over.
It is actually out on the steam store right now.
Ask the Magic 8 Ball again later. We can't predict your future.
I love how [NAME] touted the Hong Kong model as something beneficial. What a joke.
This is cursed
Cant agree more on the first part but for the last, it comes out too harsh.
[NAME] just ripped his jersey. He‚Äôs frustrated as hell right now
See, I missed it completey, so they must have glossed over it fast. 
ALFBRUSHJANSBYSY SUCH A GOOD DOGGO
good job with being proactive with mental health.
well you done did it lol
You are the parent your grandson deserves. Your daughter will regret the pain she has caused.
Fuck the fucking refs. Seriously. Fuck those fucking cunts. I'm so fucking mad. Fucking dickless fucking street walking fucking sluts.
just get the paper that say it is real and see how shit it is.
I think you might be underestimating some people sadly.
Ugh foot rubs. I feel embarrassed thinking about how my nmom used to make me do this to her. Ugh ugh ugh
You can't control what happens around you. You can only control how you react to it.
Plus there's this expectation/trope of flowers sent to workplace being a way for someone who's fucked up to apologize (which is icky as hell but whatever)
You poor, hideous creature. 
It doesn‚Äôt help
I usually see tweets like this for girls but it feels nice to have it directed at boys
No problem, hope things get better for you guys soon!
Hahaha good point!
"That comment about ""kill him with kindness"" was kinda unnecessary. How about just kindness for kindness sake? lol"
It's a shame you didn't get to see the event live. At least your followers get to see nice vertical view of what was going on.
Lol I use an apple charger that‚Äôs split in half to charge mine so I think ur fine
Loving the circle-jeck hate, how about not getting so triggered by other people taking offense at an ad
Yeah, my mom would tell at and hit our family dog. She was a tiny little dog too. :(
Not surprised...he has ZERO interest in finding a job and living like a responsible adult...
The other ending in the therapists office was the best in my opinion. Very White Bear-ish
I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
But if you go to fredmeyer, which is also Kroger, It's like 50% cheaper on most things. lol.
Sorry, spelling [NAME] Smearing* Motherfukers* 
I‚Äôm a fan of your awareness for others here. This sub needs more of that lately.
What a great haircut
my 3.5mm jack came with my iphone se and I can literally never lose it as long as I have my phone.
I'm so gay I can't even drive straight - a bumper sticker older than most redditors
The pistons are aggressively mediocre which sucks. [NAME] has been awesome but the rest of the team is horrid
K. If you can't see that staffing and turnover are a contributing factor to quality of care then idk what to tell you. Cheers.
Is there some scripture you could quote me? I'd like to read up on it just to be sure for myself
Well I like [NAME] but other than her, I don't know any interesting asian youtubers. so help me out
Yeahhhh no, you're banned for this whole convo.
As someone with sinus and breathing problems, this makes me anxious and short of breath just looking at it.
Utter nonsense from yourself.
Honest mistake but I deserve and will accept the shame xxxx
Sounds like you have the situation firmly under control. Keep maintaining boundaries, focusing on the things that matter, and ignoring her need for drama. 
I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say ‚ÄúF*CK YOU‚Äù every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me
I am already using ublock. Thank you for suggesting ghostery, didn't know it.
I love the way he starts kicking the guy while holding the 2 Ak's
Crating your dog is also banned in some places, that doesn't make it cruel.
I wish it wasn't so crumbly. It feels like sand in my mouth.
I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.
Thanks, came here for this
Congratulations! It's an amazing feeling isn't it! üòç
I'm sorry you poop your pants every time someone mixes those words up.
I upvoted this comment because I'm a dumbass snarkball who doesn't know how anything works.
That son of a bitch!
‚ÄúDo you guys actually disagree with the idea of taking [NAME] constitutional rights without due process‚Äù [NAME] -signed a gun owning lefty liberal
Let's not name anything after him. Even if it's a disorder, the incels will take it as recognition and pride.
*She. This was posted by a woman, apparently. Its just as disgusting either way though.
Good job...
A UBI has to be sustainable. Taxing something to reduce its use and funneling that money into something people would depend on is absolute stupidity.
Thanks kindly!
The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by. 
Your sacrifice will be remembered.
Thanks for the info, appreciate it. 
I would pay good coin to read that love story.
Well said. Glad to see that there are still open minded people left in this sub.
Nobody would flop like that in practice
Or maybe he does, and that‚Äôs why he scared of people thinking that; he‚Äôs afraid of people finding them out.
Anyone else not like optics logo this year. The 2 greens look awful
Don't do that. Only villains do that.
My favorite pod when they are fresh & clear. Sadly, all of my recent packs look like dark brown syrup pods. 
I almost thought this was gonna turn into a story of your tissue you'd been reusing for months. I'm glad it was not lol
Everytime I see something in this sub that looks sharp, I get very worried. 
It's nice for him to take time out of getting angry at people to lecture everyone.
Looks like a pretty good plate overall!!
This is so good! Thank you I love this way of thinking of it. That might be helpful to explain it to them.
You dodged a bullet. She sounds like she's easily manipulated and they're nightmare in laws. Bad combo
Yep. I have a reading goal along with my weight loss goal.
Lol posting It on my story? Ya I was expecting alot of hate from my post XD my friends know me tho lol
Falling for such low quality bait
No, thats just the glare from the sun
Why all the downvotes? It's a fucking pizza thread?
Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
Sorry, I wish I was wrong, but Mathews is over rated
I liked [NAME]...
It's the same couple of people. The only thing I really dislike about this subreddit is that it swings to the left too hard sometimes.
Thank you for the kind words, that's very sweet.
I know, and the unfortunate thing is many of my friends in this area have had somewhat similar experiences with dudes who just are just total creeps. 
GIVE ME OTHER PEOPLES MONEY!!!!!
This has nothing to do with weebs, anime, mlp, katana, or 4chan. This is just doesn't belong hear.
Why am I gonna do? Stop the ant? I‚Äôm scared of him too
It‚Äôs literally a meme ideology. Sstaaaaahhhhpppp
This was last year. Didn't go, definitely should have. I'm fine though 
Unfortunately I don't know how to read hangul. I'm still in the very early stages of planning so still lots of things to look at!
Man, she took it pretty well. I‚Äôd be screaming my damn head off. 
Injury history alone makes him super unattractive.
"C1,2 7.30 pm [NAME] to [NAME], ""I how how you can throw down"" HAHAHA!!! "
I like you. You're smart, cheeky, and funny. Well played.
It‚Äôs still undeniably them though. Drawn in the foreground in somewhat true color to make sure it‚Äôs a clear homage.
That unconvincing bottom right though hahaha
What a sad post. I cannot believe people actually follow their advice.
It is part of the political game unfortunately.
The few people that survive jumping from bridges say, almost invariably, that they regretted jumping the second they entered free fall.
I hope [NAME] does get a new devil trigger. I‚Äôm sorry but seeing the same one repeatedly has gotten old.
Because different characters have different advantages. Why do questions like this still get asked?
Fuck it; just marry everyone
[NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i‚Äôll fucking cry
His wrists are too small ‚òπÔ∏è
Pls shut up
The lucky ones died quick
Her comments are disgusting. Reminds me of my mother. I'm so sorry.
It's extremely common. Hell you probably have it yourself and just don't know.
LOL. When she came back on after the first commercial break, there was loud beeping when she was talking. 
Oh my goodness I was there yesterday! Luckily I didn't get bitten.
Nope. But if this also occurs in Dallas, that‚Äôs quite disheartening. :(
That‚Äôs one of my favorite movies pans labyrinth.
It was a good sub before the porn took over
For some reason this post is making me crave an apartment.
Hell yes üòÅ I loved it.
#Fuck the cowgirls & iggles
#1 rule you don‚Äôt say it you can think it but never say it
I appreciate the pointer. It definitely sounds like something I‚Äôm capable of. I‚Äôll reach out to them.
Aw crap you're right. Sorry I suck at names and shit
"""oh that wasn't me, my baby brother must have grabbed my phone"" "
Pretty sure [NAME] graduated, and I would assume the [NAME] thing has to be related to the injury...
I'm jealous. Wish I was in fl on my porch.
This live action version is good but whats the original anime?
Yeah no one is gonna do that and get reported to HR for bigotry.
This sounds like a great idea! Stop STUPIDITY Act
I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. 
[NAME], he fucked everything up so bad.....and I love him but, damn
[NAME] has been really good this game and I thought he was good against the coyotes as well.
The fact that her pillows are brown is way more disturbing to me
Angry old men raise their canes when angry. Raising Cane's is a fast food chicken finger chain.
You know, I‚Äôm something of a friend myself
They will most likely be branded as PKK symphatizers by Turkish media. Which sucks because next time something like this happens some of them might get shot
Nice try cat daddy ;)
Yeah [NAME] is a pretty weird guy.
no worries, just clean your room
I love to see the Celtics give up [NAME] and [NAME] only to have [NAME] walk to literally any other team
Wow, that would have been messy.
People who mindlessly defend Turkey and Ergodan are very delusional!
If we don‚Äôt get [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], or [NAME]..... I‚Äôll be so sad 
i got a bump and a bald spot. i feel dumb <3
Wow that was ...mind blowing.
That‚Äôs not how totaling works.
im trying to but my depression gets the better of me i have my good days and bad days
You're still going after this man, you posted from your alt account, give it up and take the L. It's not emasculating at all.
We are. EU regulations, laws created by the European Parliament. Don't say something that is blatantly untrue
I‚Äôm downvoting because it seems like r/iamverysmart material.
That was intentional as fuck. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
Turns out, that daddys little girl is a thot, who also takes drugs. No wonder she fled her country.
Honestly rams are my second NFC team. I wanted you to win it all since the beginning of the playoffs and I love the team even more now
Oof lmao sorry buddy
Ah so gang rapes aren't a thing anymore, eh? Glad to hear that. 
> i dont want people to have bad lifes. Exactly, but apparently many people not only admit this but gloat about it.
Thanks for this!
I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that
I wouldn‚Äôt worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. 
30 you illiterate fuck
If it makes you feel better im gonna be scrubbing out hard for a while so maybe ill see you round to give me another loss
Wait, so you uploaded a post in which you did something nice. That's a bit narcissistic. 
Sub... chill... I see what you did there...
Good [NAME] we look horrible
Oof... I mean I definitely welcome a dramatic population decrease but I wish we could've done it in a more intentional manner *before* irreparably damaging the environment
While true, that's not what they're talking about here
Nah. It's their job. Just tip well
Eh, loser. It‚Äôs sad how some people don‚Äôt care about their relatives.
No, a plot hole means that your story lacks logical consistency 
I wish the theme was still larger than life but their outfit prompt was fetish/bdsm wear and that they all posed next to giant sex toys
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
A true internet classic.
"They get pissy about ""automatic defenses"" for property. I mean, *REALLY* pissy."
I'd say we should dump him somewhere at sea but the oceans are already pretty polluted... :(
> lots of ppl dont enjoy pvp I feel like these people are playing the wrong game genres lol.
This shirt IS a problem. Get rid of it.
Because the PS4 doesnt have any incredible exclusives? Edit: I was being sarcastic, please stop trying to teach me which games are good PS4 exclusives :(
Can‚Äôt believe people still fall victims to those machines.
CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I‚Äôm so sick of speculation. Let‚Äôs quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
Does he report it to the police? I didn't see that part. I believe him. Stranger things have happened.
Chronicles of Elyria seems interesting
happy to help
Achilios too good
Lol I have my moments!
This is on a video about electric guitars what the fuck?
Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it.
A cheater is always a cheater in my book.
This is actually kinda cool, I like it!! 
No worries! Sometimes wires get crossed, I missed the mark as well.
I want this cat
But not to the folks screwing him at the gas department.
You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice.
I thought sex would be a great stress reliever.
I get your point. But really, the low prices is just a trap to get more men in lookout for action. It's sad.
Provided you didn‚Äôt break any of their rules, you should email OKC support.
You fucked up. You trusted them.
I think the [NAME] biscuit joke takes the cake
Oh thanks, ~~[NAME]~~ Mitt. We all know you won‚Äôt provide meaningful opposition to [NAME].
Imagine ur mom doing that I‚Äôm crying
I was thinking 1-2 in each eye might stop the threat, but if I'm being honest I'd be worried about the ensuing legal struggle...
Sounds like they‚Äôre not responsible and shouldn‚Äôt have the right to have these.
fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.
I would like to see the tree as well! :D:::
Damn it.
It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
you're a true hero
tbh college has been a hair easier for me than high school. The worst of it is making tuition and trying to register for classes
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one.
Aww that's so sweet !
Is it a radical opinion to say no two consenting adults should not be able to kill each other lol
Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
And my apologies if I misinterpreted but you seemed to state multiple times that it keeps you from seeking other women, such as the [NAME] example.
Funny you ask
Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.
I like [NAME] so far but making shots that you missed in the first half aren't coaching adjustments
Obviously. Every post here is intended to be a joke. Just not funny ones, like this post.
Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That‚Äôs a fact. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you.
They should be liable for this abuse. It‚Äôs just insane!
You realize I hate trump right? You‚Äôre super annoying I‚Äôm not dealing with this
I'm glad that yours is getting slightly better too! Keep on working on it and you'll be a social butterfly someday!
I just came off of watching all of his movies. Dear [NAME]. I love and hate them at the same time.
Good stuff [NAME]
I just want someone who listens to scientists. That's too much to ask though.
[NAME] is also very creative with the puck, I'm mostly liking the new guys so far.
Congrats! You have succeeded in your pathetic life.
I would have to agree. He acts for himself and wants revenge but also cares for and respects life so, chaotic neutral.
Dig up, stupid! 
You‚Äôve really added to the conversation, thank you. Stop reposting news articles for karma it makes you look fucking pathetic.
You've been checking in on all us 3.8 billion females? That's impressive.
Appreciate the reply, I'll look into these. Thank you!
Interesting. See, that seems much more adult. And actually makes sense. The things we do in the US man...
How the fuck do you moan tho
Rip time wasted editing, its a shame that not many other people saw this
Excellent summary.
Fantastic! Thank you for the info sir!
looks like your fake autism you used to use for attention still has its side effects :/
Nice try GRU.
Go for it, it will be a new experience it may not go good but you'll learn someway 
TLDR; we get many drizzle days and our summers are amazing.
I do this everyday... lol
Good job Mr [NAME]. That is all
correct. i am the one who decides if something is funny to me or not.
Watch it!! It's amazing
If they could just let us customize the lines it‚Äôd be fine
I laughed.
I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning her self and had a discharge, so what? 
[NAME], my eyes are hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now.
I hope your gaydar has leveled up enough to filter these out now
Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
That isn't the ideal female body nor is it /fit/ That's a fetish
Here we go. What‚Äôs wrong with them.
I'd be terrible at this, I eat so slow.
This team + 2 lottery picks and another offseason for our young players will definitely be a playoff team next year.
Thanks man! This was great. :-)
You guys are a problem.
I'll Google it, thanks again!
My brother fell asleep on the beach once and his whole back turned purple from sunburn and yours is still worse than his! My [NAME]!!
She is my favorite model from American Eagle store. Such beauty and so positive.
Damn! Kids these days don‚Äôt give me much hope for the future. It‚Äôs supposed to be a flaming dr pepper ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
No, but even if you did, you'll find nothing special.
You arent going to be making 10 million dollars in your business, this wont affect you.
"This has happened to me with the girls I tried to connect with irl as well as FA ""lonely"" girls from this very sub"
I did that in origins but now that theres mercenaries and its sooo annoying to deal with them so i stay as quiet as i can until im caught.
Underrated comment.
LOL! You're fucked.
Watch it in German but use English subtitles trust me
I know she's literally only just been revealed, but I *love* the name [NAME]
nice, was a big fan of REQ but haven't kept up with their progress much the last year
Sounds dreadful.
I would absolutely claim it and yell that my Auntie was looking for it.
Underrated joke... haha
I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
Hopefully created a monster. Also, I killed the morning at work.
Yes!!!!! THIS!!
True dat, I lost hope a LONG time ago
Tried to fight multiple times, cried, fallen over, and refused to eat... Sounds like my toddlers...
[NAME] thank you. Someone with a rational mind.
üòÖ thanks bew bew
I can actually read it easily now. Good work
Ohhhh, that makes sense. Cheers mate 
I couldn‚Äôt imagine putting a brand new car on these roads, let alone a Tesla.
d'oh, my bad üòî
Honestly i'm fine with any picture as long as it contains at least one dog
"Justifying a potential rape because ""it's [NAME] and she should feel thankful,"" Wow. "
how the absolute fuck did black panther get nominated for best picture? its marvel action schlock at its worst. blackkklansman on the other hand is a great movie
I like the new colors significantly better. Old ones might have been some of the worst in OWL.
"""Electricity scam""? ...and I'm pretty sure [NAME] is not an idiot."
thats one proud daddy!
[NAME]!
That‚Äôs a great idea! Thank you :)
"1.) Its not real socialism 2.) All government is socialism pick one ""socialists"" fire departments arent socialist "
I'm at 133 wins. I'll probably try to get 17 more since I'm so close and they eextendedthe season, but it seems kinda meh
I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
The contempt from [NAME] in these threads lately is seriously disappointing.
And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
I'm starting to think im being rased by narcissists lmao
Your idea of what a nice entre or nice wine cost at a restaurant are... Interesting....
You're an awful human being.
Ignorance is the worst thing that can happen to someone
HE SHOOTS AND SCORES!!!!
I just cant imagine someone insulting a guy by comparing him to one of the most successfull child actors. (I know who [NAME] is)
That kid is beautiful
I wouldn't get your hopes up until you've been dating a while.
I feel this in my soul.
In that case you're very welcome to call your representative and tell them to agree to a bill which would reopen the government. Or tweet the president.
You are right and why you get downvoted?
That's not the plan. If it were, the backstop wouldn't be controversial. The plan is divergence.
This was wild, laughed the entire post
>an absolute cuck Only a cuck would use that unironically so yeah probably
I completely agree they got fucked on that no call. And I absolutely love it.
Fascinating, can you please provide some more detail on the pre-KOOP origins of the phrase friend : )?
Hate to see him go. The only thing I‚Äôm complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
yes and I'm glad that this nonsense stops with me
Nice, thanks man
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** Korrk! ^(hug)
Pet-sitting is over, didn't know I was lonely without a doggo until now. 
sending my thoughts and prayers LOL to your family!!! üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
Absolutely same.
No, this was changed years ago. Schools don't lose funding.
Yeah that‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm most worried about, still hopeful!
Have to stay positive! I AM getting a new job I love in the field I want to work in!
medical care in the US sucks.
I like in Iowa. The weather part is true
I‚Äôll bet the Phillies owner had a beer with [NAME] high school baseball coach.
It's even worse when one considers that they are intent on moving to Europe and that by moving to a developed region their carbon footprint will increase significantly.
You will be fine.
Also do something special no matter how corny it might be to reward yourself. You deserve it friend!
Yup, I must be overreacting too and it's not a big deal. It's amazing the justifications used for this nonsense.
Yeah...it's difficult to have sympathy for someone like yourself
If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME].
"Seriously. ""Haha british people pronounce something funny"" ""Yeah well your children are murdered in violent attacks and your healthcare system puts millions in crippling debt"" "
Yup this game just gets worse and worse
Omg I can't stop giggling lol!
you would love the episode of the boondocks called the return of the king.
Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
I really enjoy my job but I get paid $62k I don't know if that's considered high paying but it's plenty for me.
Fuck those people, there's no point thinking about them
Rough comment to read but glad I did. Thanks for the write up.
No, no, please don‚Äôt make me see [NAME], please!
Uhhhhhhhhh well that's not good
No, sex is a reward, and he doesn't deserve it.
i was not prepared for this
See but it‚Äôs so common an attitude that it didn‚Äôt come off that way
THIS. Thank you for this.
Nobody likes you
Making DC climate an unapologetic brutality with blistering dry winds and no snow on a typical day.
Oh to find someone who loves you enough to put a blanket over you when you‚Äôre sleepy. That‚Äôs the dream.
I look cuter in red P‚Äôs.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll never have a playoff mandate‚Äù go fuck yourself [NAME]
Nah, I lied. I don't judge people's kinks and I like that [NAME] always moves me.
Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked.
I would not recommend water panties, you might find things a bit squishy! ;)
I once was the 2001st like on a youtube comment. It felt really good to be able to constantly flip that like count between 2K and 2.1K.
account got suspended lmao
Never understood the hype with the Beatles. All of their songs to me sound like unfinished demo tracks
You are disgusting.
I really hope I don‚Äôt ever experience a mid life crisis at all. But if I do, I at least want to act my age.
As an autism mum, I can‚Äôt thank you enough. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This makes me feel better about some of my poor decisions.
I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down
"Wallah Lmao It's ""voila"""
What‚Äôs worse is that the judge and businessman are old college buds.
Hoping Heavy Machinery get the win. Would like to see them as champs.
[NAME] just might be the hardest working man in hockey.
Apologies, I should have been more specific. Where abouts is JD? 
‚ÄúThe game is trash but I want it.‚Äù Great logic.
its ok i understood
>You can't do anything about it now, and nobody cares. Hundreds of thousands would disagree with you.
I would agree, but at the same time if it pisses off [NAME] supporters enough to keep them home in 2020, I'm all for it.
No I don't, but I'm assuming they are true for arguments sake Why is more stress relevant or bad? 
Good to know üòä
[NAME] and [NAME], are hands down my favourite AC characters.
I know and I really genuinely wish there was something I could do or say to help you take this pain away and to help you feel better.
Nah it's not that, [NAME] is just boring and sad
You're not missing anything, don't worry about it.
"I love the need for HAES and setpoints and special illnesses in normalizing fatness - because it's not like they can comfortably label marginalization ""gluttonophobia""."
Brush your teeth and neither of these smells will be reduced by chewing a napkin. But it's funny to convince a friend at a bar that it'll work
That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia
They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.
Beat my second wife cuz obviously she put the evil eye on my first wife
"He loved [NAME] ""old man in a park"" painting!"
True but the majority of plastic used is for the shelved grocery items. Pasta, rice, coffee are in every household and are all packaged in plastic 
Darn. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. I honestly am out of ideas and I don't know what to do.
Good luck with your short
That‚Äôs so precious and sweet üò≠
Yes, yes he did
Mmmm looks like some delicious asbestos tile being rubbed there.
I love polo shirts
hugs back! thank you for writing and being here with me.
And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
When are you and dad going to pop out a few baby-mammas for us boys, huh? And that's the *less* disgusting alternative. Blech!
There‚Äôs a special place in hell for u
Lol, oh man. Well, if we can laugh at our kids, what can we laugh at? Never a dull moment.
The fact someone could read your post and literally go and do this saddens me.
Surely the error is lexical. And I think the original comment is poor (non native) idiom use
Geez. The guy had a bad day over a year ago. Let it go.
I was just gonna post this haha. My fave my part
I always loved the voice he did here.
That‚Äôs awesome.
I agree but if we fell behind we lost the game without any chance. But let us be grateful that we have a Toplaner that is really godlike xd
Hi [NAME]. Nice to meet you, I'm promet. 
Oh man! Oh boy!
[NAME] is ruining the Pittsburgh Steelers culture...don't fucking @ me. Sinking fucking ship
Lmao. Idk why this made me laugh out loud so hard. Ig cause it‚Äôs actually true lol.
I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!
God [NAME] is awful
I'm sorry but are you implying that everything to the right of full-blown communism is the center?
Bro. You think roads and infrastructure wouldnt be built if it wasn‚Äôt for the government? My sentiment still stands. I pity you.
Just doesn't really work if the DM doesn't want it to...
Your comment reminds me of that one satirical GTA V radio ad where the advertiser tries to encourage people to beat their kids. It's kinda funny.
hahahahahahahahaha that post history oh [NAME] mods please dont delete this its too good
I do love the Baroque style as well! All the Church‚Äôs I ever saw in Mexico especially the cathedrals in are simply amazing.
Omg. It's Viv from [NAME] !
Aquaria just lost her shit when the Cup Toss challenge went awry
I guess they still have hopes to keep AD...
You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
I would be unfulfilled and unhappy. I enjoy meat, thankfully I own my own plot of land and can hunt on it at will.
I kiss the shade all dude. His username was trewdat. I miss that guy.
I am glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one. I thought wow they‚Äôre really gonna get it for this one
"ick! That makes me feel gross. I have ""Addison's Disease"". "
These posts must make people want to be security guards.
[NAME] has gotta he replaced or that was just terrible writing
Didn‚Äôt know if you knew, so I was just trying to give context to your statement. Sorry. 
Lol you wish it was that easy. Lying POS customers have the advantage with review websites sadly.
"I don't filter it out because I enjoy my daily cringe from the constant open letters. ""To the ____ who ____"""
If the doctor has given the ok, give some ibuprofen for teething pain FFS!
Good idea. With the power of those two consoles combined we might be able to get the fps up into double digits
EVERY POST YOU MAKE IS AMAZING THANKS MY MAN
Ah the good old Russian Right Hook.
Ha ha ha. That was a good one
Thank you :D
Fear mongering.
Oh my bad, i didn't know, thanks for telling me!
My dosage was increased 2 weeks ago and I've noticed the issues getting worse. With your comment, I'm really leaning towards them being side effects.
This is simply honesty + humility. Indeed, very respectable.
I had dream where someone said this to me having no idea it was him
I hope google does this so that everyone would leave them already.
Happy for u!!
My mom signed me up when I was 15. Wow that was a fun weekend. /s
Haha. This is awesome. And I can't unsee it.
This was driving me NUTS!
If u see the show you would realize that swearengen it's motivating the journalist, everyone will run in to painful situations some give up, some fight back
This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
Eh I kinda won't him less now. I like the chase
A part of my soul died from reading that. Thank you for making me dumber from this experience.
I am just like this! Glad to know I‚Äôm not imagining it.
It sucks it didn‚Äôt work out good luck in cincy and thanks for that Alcs game
Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.
[NAME] stated that Ethtrader polls will be used for important community decisions. So I can see people trying to buy influence through Donuts in these decisions.
Let me just say that your posts over the past twelve days have brought me so much joy
Love the headline though
Those other countries clearly exploited to shit? Dats cuz it's not mah [NAME]. -You with your big brain logic.
Completely miss-wired! I never thought a kid can grow up miss-wired.
Thats pretty lewd.
Yeah but people are dumb and mesh everything together because thinking about specific situations is clearly too hard
The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it
And with the federal laws about how little time they can drive before forced breaks, they work less than any shithead salaried manager and great pay
I'd still try to pet it
Oh my, it belongs to r/comedyheaven. Laughed for a good minute
I was expecting her to come in to work looking like [NAME] from the [NAME] show...
I have considered that, and if is possible, I will see where it leads me, thanks.
Well, he was until season 3, which was ironically when [NAME] made them take that test.
This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
That's so disappointing. I'm sorry that happened to you. It really is hard to make friends as an adult.
Happy new year /r/newyorkmets. Everyone in this community makes this place feel seriously special. Let's go win a world series in 2019.
Go on the website it‚Äôs super easy to get hired loading trucks that‚Äôs for sure
one of my all time favorite episodes i even love the closing animation of them crossing the bridge out of the
Sooooo much upper body strength. My GOD the muscles. He's positively rrrrrrrripped!!
[NAME] and I play with people with 400 plus spm and still play noobs please stop the excuses if you‚Äôre getting wrecked you just suck
If you eat plants, you are eating animal‚Äôs food. That is so cruel!
Congratulations! I'm sure your shoulders are much lighter now. You look absolutely gorgeous, keep killing it :D
that is awesome! i've been looking into going to therapy myself. glad you were able to have a great experience.
There‚Äôs a big difference between ‚ÄúI felt bad for her but there was nothing I could do‚Äù and ‚Äúnot my problem.‚Äù
Ok, I get a feeling that you might be a bit too radical here. I'm not going to keep trying here, have a nice day.
Horns‚úîÔ∏è Tail‚úîÔ∏è Legs of furry animal‚úîÔ∏è Buff avatar‚úîÔ∏è Crazy brilliant collors‚úîÔ∏è Super active on twitter and son of the sin‚úîÔ∏è Yeah sure
Danm you can hear that little bastard squeaking.
I think this title is biased. It groups all media improperly.
üò• I feel so sorry. He'd be proud of you. *Hugs*
I find your lack of [NAME] disturbing.
I don‚Äôt think you even know what you are talking about yourself
I honestly have no idea what [NAME] offers Genuinely don't rate him
You need to see a feeding specialist. Outright refusal to eat to the point of starvation is almost always a serious issue.
Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience.
Be careful, or he'll have to use 10% of his power on you!
Lol I know, gross right? I'm hate watching the tell all again right now haha
Why is [NAME] still getting minutes? He is probably the worst player on this roster.
Thank you so very much for this. Our culture seems to frown upon the mindset of leaving them out to dry.
Does he even own a pair of airpods? Broke boi.
I see some text on dark background is mesmerising.
I just walked past y'all! Wish I had seen this thread earlier.
You know nothing about this guy... this is a not cool thing to say.
Edited : Sorry meant to reply to a post
Skiing is great but I haven‚Äôt been skiing yet this season rip
we are scared on /r/bengals rn
They are loving this choice in maga canada of course. Just a typical day of bigotry.
Oh that‚Äôs terrifying
Yeah....each state gets two senators regardless of population. None are favored. Population is represented in the House.
I went through that phase, I was quite depressed. 
that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
I'm really proud of you for standing up yourself like that!
Be careful of ticks tho
I am so sorry that happened to you.
AW YEAH HUGE WIN FOR FEMINISM AND WOMEN AMIRIGHT GUYS /s
That‚Äôs awesome man!
Get out of my head.
Thank you. I hope things get better for you, and I believe in you, too.
Love to see pics like this.
This was beautifully written.
Ah good, now I don't have to do it.
>So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
Holy fucking shit
So happy for you two !! ‚ù§Ô∏è
And KAT with 6. Weird game.
Damn, sorry to hear that. Hopefully the right gig will come along!
That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell.
Oh ok! Thanks for the info.And oh [NAME] I can‚Äôt imagine what that would feel like
That was a terrible pass regardless. Wasn‚Äôt close
Please no, I have a family!!!
You have to find the right woman honestly and its sad that divorce is so punishing
His base is too large to knock him off. Unless he gets impeached/indicted/god knows what, he‚Äôll probably be it (sadly). 
That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you‚Äôre interested : )
i‚Äôm fking crying lmaoooo
If you still have fish or plants, I would love to take them. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have space for another tank
dude, thats grave danger for sure. thats terrifying. he was a predator for young men interested in sports cars. luring in for diabolic purposes!!
All the centrist liberals in the comments are furious...
Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives.
Omg creepy!
Then getting irrationally angry when they don‚Äôt see it your way.
These people have absolutely no confidence in their ability to make a living. It‚Äôs pathetic.
Steakspeare in Love
Oy vey, [NAME] üóë is gonna be *pissed*!!!
Turns out you can polish a turd. The trouble is, it's still just shit.
My entire body aches now
Our best hope is that [NAME] intends to outlast [NAME] and serve under President [NAME].
Hmmmmm that is interesting. I wonder why you were told different. I think I'm going to email support and ask.
given his form over the last year or so, turning into nueur would have gotten us that goal haha
Don‚Äôt forget sports gambling. THEN we‚Äôll be happy.
Best decision of your life.
Oh, you play on Skelth too. Actually, my laptop almost died during that one))) But somehow I managed through that haha
This girl looks STRONG!! I want her to be my goddess and I will please her on command!
I‚Äôm sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I‚Äôm constantly getting worse.
Oh I see. Thanks for letting me know. I fixed it now. The real link is HERE
sorry you have to deal with things like that. i hope things are better where you are now
The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
Thanks man, words give me strength
Article is good. Not sure how it relates to ‚Äúcarve outs‚Äù for law enforcement.
It‚Äôs a shame we have to face the islanders so soon
> I know I should feel happy why
When I'm the fifth Hokage I'm gonna make sure no one has to go through that sort of abuse! Believe it!!
He is way overrated.
You people are awful. Those are *Haggisus Australis*. They're a protected species!
Thank you for not just writing some bullshit and actually being creative. Followed this sub for scary ideas but usually get cliche garbage. So Again, thanks
imagine if this was a league youtuber. HOW TO GET FROM IRON 4 TO PLAT 1 INSTANTLY, ABUSE THIS BEFORE IT GETS FIXED!!!
>Cannot predict now Guess it's on you now /u/smackspr!
"Let me remind you that I'm 5'6"" and I still think all that thinking is ridiculous."
they just want someone to agree with them and tell them they're right. that's all these sorts of posts ever are.
Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh
I can feel that man's feelings and I'm crying
I wish ours was like that.
[NAME] consistently being the guy with most energy. We need him on the floor more.
Same here. And I really dislike strangers and groups, so groups of strangers are a next-level nightmare. 
I am not expecting this to be an easy task... üò¨
Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
I had a breakdown last night at around 3AM.
Why was this post removed? It wasn't even bad.
Yeah I would have loved it if those things actually contributed something to the gameplay
I wish I could draw... :L
I know this is a joke but people on this sub actually think this way lol.
Everything purdue throws up goes in. Frustrating. Need to find a way to get stops or this ones over at halftime
so doing something illegal only dehumanises you when caught?
But transit is amazing here.
Actually I love cooking and good burgers but if I don't love **you**, you'll have to pay me to make one.
I understand it but I hate it and I personally believe it promotes toxicity
Ya missed a clue there, Guess it never hit ya!
He actually looks pretty crackin'
I'm glad she made it as easy on you as possible.
I'm fairly new to this group and just realized my nightmares started the day I joined. However, I still somehow love it!
I think someone else should open a drive through so I can enjoy the flavours without the dishes aha
Grandmother got into an accident many years ago, and walked away with broken ribs.... it took her a couple years before she found out
[NAME]. Your mom will never be your boys best friend. That part is so cute!
She was carrying all my burdens >:((
This is so amazing üòç
I would like to thank this game for being over on time. :)
That was nasty... but also the most real thing I‚Äôve seen on the show lately.. lol
Given [NAME] viability prior to the 2016 election, I think the viability bar is set pretty damn low.
Ohhh you're an incel. Your opinion doesn't matter. Back in your hole smeegle
Ahahahahahaha!!
Which is stupid because conversations about race and slavery in America are primarily about race in slavery in America.
TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
Looks like a cool location.
nope. not hers.
It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
> the fact that it is illegal Watch out, we've got a time traveler over here!
Can you imagine not being able to pick your nose THE WHOLE GAME ! Those poor bastards.
Sex dolls/robots are gonna replace them any away. Funny that. 10 years ago nobody would have thought that sex workers would be replaced by robots.
[NAME] also slept with his dads mistress, [NAME] is weird
What a unit
At no point in the game has that been true
Happy birthday! Drinking one for you tonight. When you get up tomorrow you can take the first step to making sure next years birthday will be better!
Hopefully it helps you keep your emotions in check rather than letting others control you, [NAME].
You are amazing
It‚Äôs time to stop lad, it‚Äôs getting a little embarrassing now...
Thank you ladies !
"Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
Congrats y'all!!!
Or just shoot them. Shooting annoying people is why guns exist.
Fuck [NAME] for continuing to give her a platform.
And here I am, with no promotion after 3 years. Anyways, congrats for yours.
He‚Äôs not that into you. Move on.
Correct. The LTB judgements are enforced by going through small claims. Which makes for another hurdle for tenants trying to collect judgements.
I love how this sub is so sensitive. Some people just havent seen them IRL!
Uh, yeah. That was a dumb question and if you thought it was going somewhere you re dead wrong.
Erin's is so precious
Well dayum that was cool.
Fair enough. I'm probably thinking of someone who still has some semblance of shame.
For crying out loud, all they had to do was use the smegging wipers!
How did they respond? You can't leave out the best part.
Take my up vote...you owe me a punchline you bastard.
Nothing about that looks comfortable
[NAME] did a YT vid and now everyone trying to be like him. Sad!
You okay, buddy? 
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
Ameen InshAllah. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôll try
Thank you for understanding. We don't want to be mean, but the rules must be enforced at all levels for all participants. Good luck with your endeavors!
I thought it was mildly interesting and don't regret watching it.
Oh I didn‚Äôt realise, sorry for my ignorance 
[NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
He takes so much abuse...and i appreciate it's him and not butcher or severson tight now.
I was messy..............then I became a minimalist.
Pls end me
Hahaha where was this when I started out.
"""AaaaaAAAaaaAAAhhh!"" I can imagine."
God damn!! Awesome for [NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] is such a great combo.
It's not even artisanal? You're a monster.
This is the day we've been waiting for! WWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Yup. I‚Äôm assuming cause it‚Äôs live crawfish and early in the season? Idk. I love crawfish cafe but not for that price.
FBI OPEN UP!!!!
That dude is Russian intelligence
This isnt a excuse. It affected their start last yr also.
Yes you can, you need to worry about em for a little while ago obviously doesn't handle as well as like 500lb heavier.
Dude want's to help his mother... cool I do the same, my mom lives in my basement. But he is doing it with my money!
His 2 point shooting has been bad this season atleast he is still staying aggressive
OH DARN IT, THANKS FOR THE REMINDER MFER!!!
"r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"
This is the dumbest post I've read today. How's that?
You started over at 46? Wow. You are badass. You give me hope that if I finally had to, I could do it.
"*""Success is the best revenge.""* Good job OP. Stay strong. You're almost there."
Rebalancing all heroes for this purpose seems like a disaster. Would have been good to think about pre-development.
Yeah I don‚Äôt see any yellow. That‚Äôs a solid bright green to me.
What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt.
Nice work [NAME]!
Yeah, live it up so you get a free trip to the zoo.
This team isn‚Äôt winning the 2019 cup. I‚Äôm focused on 2022 and beyond
I think the unluckiest... is [NAME]. :(
[NAME] helped by hosting with her 12k? viewers from the drop event. But yeah, overall the viewership has increased in general. Which is great news.
Damm. The more you know .
I was really expecting more Adidas when I read the headline
I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off.
That game hurt.
That's the death mark, Looks like you've been chosen for sacrifice. Sorry bud
Thanks for sharing, we have a new thread for today
Wow, talk about being [NAME].
kill me. lifes meaningless bc of this
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with what he said about an hour ago. Unicorns. He just ruled out any sort of
You guys don't know what you're doing to me
I adore this comment section <3
That's incredible. There was 3000 last I checked just over 2 years ago.
Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be.
tobaccy is nasty
He's not wrong.
I like [NAME] and would like to see him back, but he still makes me nervous at a high price too. 
Omg i hope this is about [NAME]. I would LOVE to see [NAME] and [NAME] go head to head
It actually depends. Do you have PCOS? Because if you do, then that would explain the change as well. 
Don‚Äôt really hear him except for the offseason and his accent isnt really overpowering and annoying.
I don't think this is bad enough for the police chief to be embarrassed. (He should be, but he won't be)
I've been playing this game since release and didn't even know that!
You are one pathetic human being.
This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!
Ayee it made it ! Enjoy
It's so sad
Trolls are okay in this sub but let's be more serious here
Jurassic world fallen kingdom was awful after they left the island
You really need to stop hanging out with those people.
Gotta play the identity politics game. She‚Äôs black and a lady.
‚ÄúHow dare you use your breasts for their biological function instead of my enjoyment!‚Äù
SHIT. I just gave my son some Skittles. Lemme edit that right quick LOL
Thank you, this makes a lot of sense. I know i need to trust them and not try and read behind what they're saying... 
I can't miss a chance to post one of my favorite gifs ever! üòÇ
Lmao doesn‚Äôt even try to refute.
 funny, your asking for proof of something the moderators actively remove and then say ShOw Me pRoOf Or ItS fAkE.
Reading this reminds me of the witch hunt scene in Holy Grail. Thanks Daily Beast!
Why are you comparing third world countries to a first world one? This speaks volume about the lack of a proper argument.
Good for them. I still don't believe a single word of it.
[NAME] bless you. Yeah I said [NAME] because we live in America,the land of [NAME]
The first time I'm seeing it so thank you for sharing. Definitely shows the propaganda efforts.
That sounds like a lovely time :D
Yep. The problem is definitely regulation and not wealth hoarding supported by corporate money controlling politics. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires unite!
[NAME] was one of the only good things in that season
Cafe hopping today! At the third one now. Might be too much coffee for me in one span though.
Look I also love dragons, but this is just not a dragon, ok? Have some Toothless *hugs*.
Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that‚Äôs just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
It's more like depression is the default state. We live in a depressing society.
Yeah, life in America is horrifying. Give me a break. 
If that mask could talk it would beg someone to end it's suffering.
The kind look on his face certainly helps
thanks, religious conservatism, for making lack of education chic.
He's being serious but the man himself is a joke.
Correct, there is no such law that obligates a woman to make her body available to gestate a fetus for someone else's convenience or amusement.
How to delete spam: Learn how to punish sigs you fucking idiot
">""tanned"" Thank you BBC, very cool!"
I had that thought as well.
I would love that, I kind of miss him
I can see it, the wig/bodysuit is very kalorie but the makeup is still 100% India
Thank you for taking the time and effort to try and understand, you sound like a good friend
Even Rolling Storm seems better, and it is not very good.
I disagree with all of what you just said but I am in the same booooaaaaat.
Yep, it's all extremely frustrating.
Thanks for this üòÇ
Cheers man, will be taking it easy for sure. 
Yeah, I‚Äôm at the dh store. so it‚Äôs far but not that far. People really are horrible. 
Me too. I didn't want to promote anybody here but there are way cheaper alternatives with shipping benefits... If you know what I mean.
Lmao Stole my joke! üòÇ
you could do that but i woulndt want that as soldier, widow or mccree. but of course reaper should not try to break the shield
Instant karma for an impatient jackass who doesn't deserve the right to drive.
It's likely that they don't have much, yet still make poor financial decisions.
This is why I could never work in construction
That‚Äôs a sweet hoodie
Why don‚Äôt people just call the cops and give them the video?
Being the most hated team of the refs is fun huh guys?
Because people hate freedom
I cried more here than in Star Wars.
[NAME]: I have a plan. Me: You‚Äôve always got a damn plan Ã∂DÃ∂uÃ∂tÃ∂cÃ∂hÃ∂ [NAME].
I like your enthusiasm and yes it would be hilarious.
And..the reality of it hurts
The super bowl isnt played in march my man
Thank you for the vote of confidence, but this experience has really effected me
[NAME] is a terrible defender, and as much as I like [NAME], I think it would be more beneficial to move his contract and sign another piece
I passed the aftermath of this wreck on the other side of I-20. What a tragedy.
rule 0: dont submit a post if you can't be not stupid
That's disgusting. Apt.
It definitely doesn't work if you give up.
Great post, thanks for coming here and sharing.
Until they find out oh she went underground üôÑ
I second that
if they‚Äôre available for questioning then you‚Äôre a shitty kidnapper. -3/5 stars
Thank you. I needed to be told that. I knew it but needed affirmation I guess.
I really hate this family. Nothing but snake-oil salesmen who's negative influence will reverberate for a new generation of young women who deserve better role models.
The 12 days of Christmas is a bizarre song. Don't use it as a gift giving guide, you crazy idiots.
4! The sweetest year.
That's the theme of this excellent play:
It was the most a receiver ever put on the Legion of Boom Seahawks though, so that's cool.
[NAME] i feel personally attacked
Dream market is also down for me in the USA
Woooooo theres the boeser we know and love
Ohh salt would have been good, but I was too pissed off to not do something more aggressive lmao
I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?
That was fun.
Fun movie, good choices of songs, and excellent visuals
Beautiful yet sad that his relationship ended in ‚Äò45 the same way most of mine do...with cheating
I don't see how my reply was whataboutism when my point of contention is directly related to the point.
[NAME]. Instantly went to moving the goalpost. Looks like my bet was a winner.
A related book for the more nerdy types is [NAME] Burnout Society. Thanks for the share, it was well worth the long read.
Ooof, I‚Äôm so sorry, that is rough.
I cant‚Äôt stand mint flavored toothpaste. That‚Äôs how much I hate mint.
Whoa you are on a big brain level!!
M'lady... Good god, the last man alive is a '[NAME]'!
thanks for the quick reply I am very bored. what anime do you like?
Yeah Q was bad card I was just bloating the pot. I definitely feel this is one of the worst hands I‚Äôve played.
[NAME] enslaved the [NAME] and MLMs enslave...well...everybody.
Oke thats really disappointing of him. Although his thoughts are constanly changing. He used to even be an ancap at some point.
It still amazes how many people on this show and family by the ton can do perfect splits lol
Goodness, If you carry on saying mean things like that you might just hurt my feeling.
and they are indeed made of gold. this seems like reasonable jewelry prices. or at least not out of left field for designer pieces.
I'm really appreciate someone saying this.
So THIS is the Bad Place!
Lakers running an awful lineup and [NAME] was too dumb to change it after the timeout. Thibs levels of Stubbornness
BALL DONT LIE
[NAME] fuckin sucks
Yeah those glimpses of the person I fell in love with too but unfortunately the glimpses are not enough which hurts :/
They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
Me too, except there‚Äôs no hookup. (I‚Äôm so lonely) 
Oi he got stabbed in the eye
Nah, you should have just listened when I tried to warn you about fake 
(apparenlty) a lawyer sending incriminating text message to a paralegal. this has to be really bad lawyer...
People are gonna end up hating Deus Ex because of this, and that's just a travesty
I had a similar fear last month after exceeding the two hours in a Homebase car park.
You can do it girl! I believe in you! :)
Looks very realistic to me. Ever been to Copenhagen? They did it despite a population density higher than San Francisco's.
That's until a golden retriever runs for office. Humans can't be trusted
Thanks, not sure how I missed that. Fixed it!
I was one of the best. I used to get at least 50 matches. Hair loss made me invisible all of the sudden
"I work at a salon and we have a ""no kids unless it's their appointment"" rule. It's amazing."
picture isnt that clear but I am 80% sure they're fake. break one and see how it crumbles.
Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks
Cuba's great. There's shredded pork everywhere
Good to know. The little chapel in there is pretty gnarly.
"Didnt know that, just saw ""LG"" devices and got nervous. Bummer for you though, that sucks :/"
This spoke to my soul. I might cry üò≠. I really do run away from my feelings
Thank you friend
I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.
Nice try..Hulu exec.
Saaaaame. There‚Äôs too many damn podcasts, and most of them are too damn long.
Glad you're at least out of bed. Progress!
I don't bother diagnosing it in people with BPD. The handful of genuine DIDs that I was referring to were people who didn't have BPD.
Not surprised, damn that sucks. Concussions are awful.
Take a shower brother, i can smell you through my phone
Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don‚Äôt let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
Stay strong! Get well soon!
Spending new years in bed hoping desperately not to wake up
I don‚Äôt want everybody to live the same way as me, I just wanted to express the stupidity of it.
Have a nice day
I would prefer to not observe it all but federal law does not allow it.
no worries! expense double date ;p I hope you have a nice time!
Don't forget the awkward tomboys.
It‚Äôs something put aside in case I really screw up and have no other option but return home
Why,? It‚Äôs natural. That‚Äôs weird af.
I don't envy people who earned what they have. I respect them. I'm jealous of people who are born or marry into money.
I have listened to him and that's how I know he's a terrible person and his goal is to turn impressionable people into terrible people like himself.
Poor crack baby üò•
Ah, yes, the good old ‚Äúglass elevator‚Äù
I love [NAME].
"I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
That‚Äôs funny cause in the movies subreddit everyone was happy about black panther because of skin color.
But it literally had. Her name on it. Kids are so fucking stupid.
Lol this cant be possible.hey thanks for the link and info! I'll look into it!
You guys are horrible. I love it.
Lmao everyone in this gif was absolutely clueless
I've never seen so many shit opinions with so many upvotes in the motherland before. Guess that's what happens when it hits r/all.
Thank you. I hope we can both/all stay true to ourselves and not to become cynical about others due to our experiences.
I wish I could forget about the redesign. Sadly reddit is adamant about reminding me all the time it exists.
[NAME]?? C‚Äômon, that‚Äôs a pretty good pull. 
Yayyyy [NAME]!!!! Now go get a hat trick tonight!
That‚Äôs always good to be away from toxic people like that. Try to keep yourself from those types of people, they can ruin your life.
Haha, no. But probably just because I hadn't thought to do it.
Everybody seems to be lost.
Lay off the drugs dude
What a dumbass question to start with...
Guys it's a dril tweet, false alarm
Sounds like a good deal to me. Where do I sign?
Ever since I could squat, deadlift, and bench more than my father he never questioned my decision. haha
This team is fucking embarrassing.
My aunt can also be very intimidating when she needs to be. It's her super power.
I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
Never mind the delays. Fish, unlike Wine or cheese doesn't improve with age.
Loved him in Gavin and Stacey! Thanks for the recommendation
Thank you!!!
> What keeps hurting her though? They are getting absolutely crushed by the crowd probably. There's always jackasses trying to push forward.
Idk I‚Äôd kind of like [NAME] to come up next year. [NAME] still scares me a little. Not saying I don‚Äôt like the guy
I also think license should be spelled liscence btw, so don't feel bad
If she is an INFJ they can be quite caustic and verbally abusive at times.
Not at all!
Probably. Government contracts are already terrible as they rarely pay on time
Posting Onion Boy here is basically cheating.
Glad you liked the lesson, don't forget to SMASH that like button and click on the bell box below to join the NOTIFICATION SQUAD
Thanks, :), as the days go by they are getting better.
It didn't take me any longer than the first, and I feel uncomfortable now
I would also like to know the answer to this. Thanks for posting!
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
2 years down the road (that is, now) every Uber driver complaining about how they re exploited and blackmailed and can't make ends meet.
I agree: most [NAME] are much better than Prophet [NAME], which directly contradicts [RELIGION] doctrine.
The word nourish makes me cringe now tbh
She's passed away.
You‚Äôre no welcome then. Get aff reddit.
"""I refuse to argue with anyone born before 1980: They don't even know how to rotate PDFs"" That is exactly how this stupid argument sounds"
[NAME] is my least favorite out of all of [NAME] love interest (In all live action movies) Bite me.
Omg that sounds like a really intense experience, how'd you save yourself after the feeling of intense happiness? 
Please point out my fallacious line of reasoning instead of insulting my intelligence. You are an example of a bigot that thinks he is wiser than everyone else.
This comment is fucking cringey lol why the fuck do you talk like that
This song was my jam in 2018. [NAME] bless you.
No matter which you pick ([NAME] or [NAME]) the dance and the date scenes were great. It genuinely makes me happy seeing [NAME] happy.
The bed is comfy and I want it to stay that way
Agree with you there, no one has a strong enough argument as for why it shouldn't be legalised
His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.
I'm not responding until you point me where any of my statements contradict cut and clear
Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop.
So cute!
True, but it'll happen sooner than a constitutional amendment will.
That's the spirit
It‚Äôs not easy hiding that Baby Huey diaper.
Thank you for doing these, i wanna learn our prospects more and this helps
Not even surprised by rudi, the man has been a beast since we got him.
FEAR THE TURTLE
It‚Äôs a [NAME], very fun guns to shoot. Nothing like a good old lever action sometimes!
Oh thanks! The bot didn't link it so I didn't know
self fulfilling prophecies are always quite fascinating
I mean I dont think your wrong at all, but I would still be happy to fight you for funsies.
oh no
You ever want to work so close with protocol and get blamed for changes in DV missions that were never communicated to you? Welcome to LRS!
It‚Äôs sad that some parents can‚Äôt accept some simple mistakes.
Nooo. Ireland will now lose those two rounds. The world is unfair
Same here. I appreciate the truckers in this sub and how they emphasize safety.
That looks pretty cool
That sounds awesome actually
Lol. Mod conspiracy theories. Yes they want to destroy the sub. That is their goal.
[NAME]: B [NAME]: B The real reason to vote these 2 to these tiers is because having [NAME] be the only A tier performer is a goodmeme.
We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
I agree that you think that. Not sure myself.
When you can't hold in years of emotional trauma anymore
Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
It just seems extremely insensitive to say that. That‚Äôs the real problem. It invalidates the other person‚Äôs suffering.
Thanks for the [NAME] quote.
People deleting and stop caring IS THE REASON why artifact is under 2k players.
Dirty secret. They retired the decks until they got a doozy.
Done it since I was a kid I was very edgy
Oh my [NAME] I saw the rocks below the dog and feared the worst!
Nah you‚Äôre good. I‚Äôd rather date someone who never married/never had kids than the opposite.
I get abused on the daily fam ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç
Absolutely terrible. But wholesome aswell.
After all that i expected it to not look terrible. Oh well.
I would have a similar reaction if she committed neck rope.
Even a Ford dealer? Thanks for responding, I'll likely sell it privately.
Enough in every catagory to be both respected by my peers and have respect for myself.
oh lol Im personally a mess. I always have been.
I don‚Äôt fucking care
Dear down voter, go to your own sub and take your childish down voting with you.
Tell them personally how you feel and that you want things to change for better
Seems like it was supposed to be funny.
The latter is a good description of the last 16yrs of my marriage (now over, thank the gods). 
Actually you're a [NAME] if you aren't for exterminating the 'wrong inherently evil and guilty race'.
I hope things get better soon. I'm proud of you for getting help and talking about it and wish you the best
I‚Äôm super proud of him. Great guy!
I hate betting unders.
Good luck.
Great write up, you‚Äôve sold me on Munchak being a good hire.
That LOD is a moron
It‚Äôs been over 20 years since I rode the 15. I‚Äôm still traumatized.
great work!
Yes officer, this one here
I love when [NAME] plays like this
Wow! You were either a very precocious child or still lived at home when your wisdom teeth came in.
Unemployment was also significantly higher at the end of Old Labours tenure than at the beginning. Yet nobody remembers that.
Normally the posts on this subreddit are pretty innocent and vanilla.....yeah not this one I think I‚Äôll pass on ‚ÄúTheDickPill‚Äù
Vancouver is even more ridiculous.
Exactly, i've never heard of dutch lessons on school anywhere in the world !?
I really need to put my foot down. Thanks for the gentle nudge :)
>It's always possible they will bring back an older villain that is behind [NAME] Ah yes. I can't wait for the [NAME] 3.0/Snoke 2.0
What did we do to deserve [NAME]? Loved that guy since his buff days
I love it. The only thing faker than their lies is them. I‚Äôm glad the girl was able to get her divorce.
Thanks boss. Finally got a sibling for the Glock!
Gmod Wonderworld is a personal favorite and may be the most sadistic and hilarious thing [NAME] has done
I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
What a neat gesture!ü§ó
Women are dangerous as hell too.
Yikes - I'm so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you like that was completely crappy on their part.
Guys who work on aircraft usually have hard time hearing. Its unavoidable.
People will stop wanting to punch/jail these people when they stop being ignorant, selfish pricks putting newborn babies at risk.
That's a lot of commitment there. 10/10
Poor attempt for karma I think
Oh, apologies. Silly me didn‚Äôt think to check the sub first.
I loved my LCR. It made me feel like a police chief from the future.
Mod to the rescue! Thanks haha
I wish I would‚Äôve! Idk why I didn‚Äôt record it I think I was just in such shock of what had just happened lol.
I take showers at night and I desperately need one atm. My hair has been really greasy recently.
Wow thank you! I‚Äôm gonna do that!
"Yeah like ""oh yeah? No shit?"""
dear... husband
That's why the other half of people call me an asshole
üòÇ Poor kitty.üíó I can hear that howl and see that face! You betrayed her! üòõ
Yeah, sorry for that one. Some opportunities are too good to pass up.
Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn‚Äôt lose a leg going that fast.
I still don‚Äôt understand what did [NAME] do? Lol
Done and done in the memory of [NAME]. I am sorry for your loss.
Y‚Äôall some sharks. I‚Äôm really just out here trying to be hopeful for the future of my team after a heart shattering lost.
Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it‚Äôs not for everyone
Do it :) You‚Äôd make my day!
That's really interesting. How come?
No, I'm anti racism.
The comic relief of the cat world - when they‚Äôre not tearing the flesh from your bones
Hey nice rebuttal. I got some new information out of that, thanks for that. It's all about learning. 
It's amazing that things like this still exist, considering how much English-language education there is. 
Uh oh. I think I love Calabro. That was a hilarious call. Gotta love it!
Lol stfu really
unrelated, but i love your flair
Nyaw :) imagine all the nice things he‚Äôll have to brag about you to his next target.
What kind of soup? Hopefully he is okay. =D
I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/
nice shot of that full moon on the first day of winter!
Thank you! In Germany and was sick of waiting and wondering
Not really someone I despise, but definitely someone I was ashamed of.
nah [NAME] ditto is a bad idea. Unless the marth is really bad he's gonna get 4 stocked quick
dear [NAME] they're multiplying...
Eat the damn rich already!
Have fun getting robbed
If you hike past the 2-3 mile.mark on just about any trail you'll lose all.the Instagram hikers.
Fortnite is not a good game anymore smh my head
I mean, those are all true for people that aren't pregnant too aside from the swelling.
She already had a child protection worker. It wasn‚Äôt her first rodeo sadly.
It's not Russian land either. Your argument is still complete nonsense.
Ok, fair enough... This one works
...i love [NAME] for what she did/does for her [NAME]. ...also, would like to see some of the work that comes out of the collective
the game certainly feels unfinished, at least on PC. some horrible mouse controls, using a controller is almost necessary.
That‚Äôs a statement I can actually get behind. Not because of anything he‚Äôs really done, but that Scientology stuff is... weird.
"Apparently a 3 year extension for DACA is what's on offer. No pathway to citizenship. That's gonna be a ""fuck no"" from me, dog. "
This stresses me out way too much.
Yup, but I love wegman's so much, although I am curious as which one this is... I am guessing Jersey or DC area
I don't see the weirdness there. Also, yes, him then and now could spit in my mouth and I'd be perfectly ok with it.
You are such a good boyfriend, keep it up!! I‚Äôm jealous :)
And even worse after 40 years!
So there's hope for the rest of us! Thanks for sharing. What helped you get to where you are?
If at first you don‚Äôt succeed...welp, nevermind.
I love gold !!
This sub is filled with bitterness.
"Can we change the ""haha"" one to when he was laughing about giving that scarecrow to [NAME] "
Get outta here and delete your post cause you're sure gonna look dumb in front of a lot of people other than me.
I have almost 5 months now. If I can do it, anyone can. You got this baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
So happy for you both!
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
This is why you should only ever do incremental payments based in the work done.
yay another let's keep nerfing survivors to the ground patch... fun
Awful taste hmmmmm
Also, note how the First Order recruits....children. That certinetly could lead to rampant abuse.
don't you get it? It's freedom to kill children now...
That's what makes the best reply you could paste the comment at mumble rap and 10 day tho.
Aww, what a cute pair
Fuck this boring ass 9-5 corporate bullshit. I feel like starting a podcast about the Bulls.
I feel so much safer when my doctors are only abusing prescription medication... /s
Our future overlords are learning how to walk and help out around the house. Growing up so fast they are. Remember that I love you
Their album is awesome, too.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** slumbishop! ^(hug)
Your teacher was pretty cool for calling you snoopydog
Ahh you poop too much
Have some more faith in him, it sounds like your husband is trying his best.
Hello, Do you need a student ID for anywhere in the process? I have a valid email but can‚Äôt find my ID right now. Thanks
Would love to own a deck like this üòç
groceries are getting crazy expensive
I am so sorry! I hope you are okay!
> It's crazy you don't understand this. i r o n y
Kinda like a thing that comes out of the ground and it smells nice, I think. Cannot confirm
Any [NAME] who are into this, hit me up! Love me some trance & techno. Can't wait for Transmission Sydney in March :)
I'm sorry for you... That sounds not cool :'(
BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
Thanks mate. I'm going to repeat your words to myself until I start believing them. Thanks for giving me a bit of hope :)
I thought he was guaranteed to sign with the Padres lol
I actually rooted for you guys that Seahawks game, but now I feel the true pain. 
doesn‚Äôt help for me unfortunately. i think if anything when i‚Äôm on BC is when i experience these symptoms
What the hell
Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead.
The one fucking thing my home town has contributed besides alcoholics and [NAME] and its a fucking backwards feminist horseshit theory.
This is true...
poor [NAME] is in jail now for assassination.
TOLD YOU ALL, bravo
Honestly, it‚Äôs probably for the best if he didn‚Äôt know his father too well.
I would give r/momforaminute a visit, the people over there are fantastic and I think they can give you some comfort 
The frankness of this comment made me giggle
I‚Äôm sorry where is that?
But he has... so it‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt but that he shouldn‚Äôt.
Unfortunately you‚Äôre absolutely right, no doubt about that 
Thank you. Just hoping I'll make it with minimum damage inflicted on my friends who are helping me move
Damn have they not heard of shelters. Bro go adopt a pupper.
What a wonderful post. Such love. Thanks so much.
Thank you! I suddenly see the benefits of Fahrenheit.
Damn, that's the only war we lost. 
üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüíï I believe in you. Stay strong
That's true for every loss except for this one. He's being really petty and hasn't taken the [NAME] loss well.
"I'm a bit late. What's the ""AAAAAH FUCKING WATER"" reference?"
Barring an injury, [NAME] will be up by May at the latest. You're not going to sign him for one month.
Oh man that title hurt my brain.
Always on the back of my mind when that's the last thing I want.
Maybe she realized that what she did was extremely stupid so she was trying to hide her face so that her shame would somehow disappear.
Congrats on the mild success of your stolen story
I love how happy the dog looks in this pic. üòä
...silly walks
I am in distance relationship so this probably me and my boyfriend for this valentine. This suppose to be our first valentine.
Maybe [NAME] needs to have a Big Mac meal and relax.
haha ye ik i was smoking weed for a while before a had to stop. thanks one love
Watch [NAME] left arm and hand as he's on the floor. Scary.
Signing a 31yr old injury prone player for 5 years 60mil is pretty stupid. [NAME] would have been similar cost wise and he isn't made of glass
Wow must be a good market. Could maybe hit up to $150 a day
Considering the whining he did in our modmail, he may not realize this.
Can't believe this game actually released in the state it's in complete joke , should be criminal
Hard to swallow pills. This sub is meh now
"Saying ""don't come into this subreddit just to start arguments about politics"" isn't intolerance."
Not everyone is as Europhilic as you, and that‚Äôs okay.
That‚Äôs about what ours is, but our rush hour traffic is horrible.
Everyone seems to forget how much he sucked as a quarterback, there‚Äôs a reason he was un drafted
You‚Äôre so close:) hope you can get one
motivation. Hope this helps you
Excelerate are looking really good yo. They've outslayed every map, are executing perfect plays. Fun, playing to their full potential.
thanks! :)
I watched a video about fake makeup having rat piss in it. No thank you
I love it. I just joined the Streetwise Facebook page to catch up on some of the kids.
Some wonderful pictures here, it's always cool to see what things actually looked like rather than just paintings/depictions in movies. 
Yes I'm sure lol every god has flaws that's what keeps them balanced
I don't think you should ever be forced to do any work, so obviously not. 
Oh man, I didn't expect that: It kept rolling on his face!
Do it successfully and coal country will still say it‚Äôs a stupid idea.
Sad... RIP
They are worth the time it takes to write them. Thank you for returning!
No but some random did afterwards. You‚Äôre welcome.
every time you see the snake edge and still get hit even though you *swear* you were holding downback
Great reply as usual
I hope these young women change the church and not the other way around.
That wasn't what I was expecting at all.
Sucks even more to be the sons that actually died ehü§î
And a hell of a lot better receivers. [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME], [NAME]. 
Theesomes won't make someone monogamous more open to solo stuff.
[NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.
3 Hours of [NAME] pissing on the floor in public
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!
if we follow this pannel she is non existent and you are just allucinating, im sorry to bring the sad news 
I just can‚Äôt imagine he is as bad as that...it‚Äôs just hard to believe.
They have problems for sure.But they don't have YOUR problems.
I'd love to see something following her younger days. Also something STRQ related would be awesome.
> I miss frequent, monogamous sex enough that I miss a relationship very much. This is really the core of why I want a relationship.
I swear if he is drafted as a father son to Gold Coast, I wont be happy
Thank you!!!
Sorry man, it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to find a Rose jersey anywhere that isn‚Äôt a 3XL
From what I remember, a lot of the leafs fans had [NAME] from 8.5-9.25. I can‚Äôt recall someone saying 10+
I feel your pain. Sitting here wallowing in self pity and anger at how I let myself go!
I'm scared to do these cuz the S.A.G.E. told me I was a transvestite
Thanks for the summary. I was having a hard time keeping up! :)
Ah that makes sense, thanks for the quick reply. I'm new to the world of working so I have no idea what's what. 
It‚Äôs pretty clear UBI is not going to actually Make the character interesting. We should stop deluding ourselves.
I'm so sorry! I hope you are doing better!
Women don't have penises so cannot rape by the legal definition of the word. They can sexually assault however.
Thanks im going to get that on a shirt u are awesome and must love everyone thanks for the help [NAME] is still president
[NAME] did that to [NAME] and let's just say that didn't end to well for anyone
Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
>very creepy horror-themed Very accurate description and only from a few second piece of an audio recording
Even more of a reason to nurse on your side! :)
i'm really disappointed this isn't a real sub because i know there are soo many good notes to go in there
This is my bestie's favorite song.
Ah, well thank you. On an unrelated note, does ‚ÄúBenchys‚Äù mean boobs?
No they can't. Rent increases has to be given notice at least 30 days prior
It's hard for me to switch between english and spanish in the same sentence, sorry I'll try to improve in the future
I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this
That's the worst possible outcome
This is a symptom of the main reason I don't drink or do drugs. F
Thanks a lot!
She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.
Thanks, didn't catch that one!
I want to know them - so I can actually murder them. (With words, that is.)
Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
A TECHNICAL Lmao.
I'm sorry for what happened to you. I guess you were sending mixed signals all the time.
I don't know why this image bothers me so much
Pay this man
Am I out of touch? No, it's the [NAME] who are wrong!
My barber was thinning my Hair with a new blade and cut my ear. Bled like crazy.
Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that.
Still undecided. May depend on how much an uber costs, lol.
Look I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but w
GOAT FLAP. Thank you! I am in the middle of hormones right now.
Yeah, the only issue with the scene is how long the dance scene goes. 
Yes, I dont trust people very much so I tend to push them away, and I feel like I dont have enough energy to keep up with people 
thanks for the thoughtful reply. but yeah I guess its mostly a pipe dream! I wish someone would post some detailed ideas and replies like this!
She manages to interview the most horrible people, as long as they're willing. Can't have an interview with someone who'll only attack your questions. 
Praise [NAME] your taste is bad /s
Damn [NAME] great move
Their orange chicken is the absolute fucking bomb. I love having it on top of a nice bed of rice and veggies :D
Hopefully but I don't think it's going to change anytime soon
Not gonna lie, I LOVE pneumatic tubes. This is now my next vacation plan.
Stop believing everything you‚Äôre told.
Atlantica combat is unlike anything else. So fun. Didnt know it was still arkund; I wish it wasnt so Asia difficult and grindy
That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
Too fast for me in the chat room. I'm on my phone and can't type that fast. Here is more relaxed and everyone is hilarious.
So glad you left this note. This is the way it‚Äôs done! Newspaper (or similar) and everything.
Literally all I wanted was some sort of evidence and somehow I‚Äôm wrong...? You‚Äôre too stupid to be real.
Humm, just a few days after I unsubbed. You aren't luring me back again though r/Murderedbywords !
"[NAME] was good in ""My Love from the Star""."
And those kids made fun of the people doing it just as much as everyone else. Source: i am a high school teacher.
i wish i could be an ex someone wanted to get back with.
 yay!!! Congratulations! You are so pretty, make up is going to look awesome on you! Your hair is beautiful too ^_^
Drink. Watch hockey. Eat. That's what I do.
That's an adorable horsie
Our volume of immigration does not mean it is easy to get in. The bar is very high and there are many applicants.
Definitely accurate, lasted about a month total in a Disney ‚Äúinternship‚Äù program... was more like slavery. Terrible experience that ruined Disney for me
He‚Äôs not a young offensive mind and that offends people.
>it should be **illegal** to teach **religion** to young children Do you believe in a separation of church in state though?
[NAME] is one of the worst announcers ever. [NAME] is one of the best.
if it's harassment its a criminal charge. I haven't read the decision yet but this seems like a stretch based on what i know.
Lol!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it.
Lol oops what season are you in so I will know what not to spoil ü§™
That‚Äôs what I suspected. Will be interesting to see if they can steal some wins against the top teams in the league.
Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There‚Äôs no escape We will all die in misery and alone
Our village prosecutor actually made that joke when the judge couldn't read my ticket.
Damn, that's dark
You really can't. So just dont worry about it
I always say thank [NAME] we can‚Äôt comprehend it!!
This doesn't even make sense!
Lol hokay guy.
It can make me angry - that and hearing my neighbors have sex
Your brother really saw the light huh!
I just googled the thing. Yeah thats it! I might have described it incorrectly but that looks very similar. Thanks!
You're going to be pissed.
Like the Whitehouse is getting stale the fuck on now.
Don't feel bad! Hopefully they both run.. their delegates should go to whoever gets more votes in the end.
I've come here to chew bubblegum and to kick ass.
Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
It‚Äôs too cold to go outside most of the year. Whining into webcams is all they‚Äôve got!
[NAME] AND [NAME] ARE SO GOOD AT DRAWING FOULS ON 3'S
I‚Äôm dreading when it happens during our games for the title
Thanks I had heard this advice, Almost botched it in November.
She's immortal now. Spread throughout the internet...shared by hapless idiots.
No group... I didn't say the guy's plan was realistic haha
Guy looks like he's taking a nasty deuce.
Great, but we can't just assume that that's the case and allow everyone to DevientArt the whole subreddit
Thank you! Not to yuck any yums, but this bloody grease stain looks like something a haunted doll would leave behind. 
I would love it as long as the art style was mature and well done
Hi, [NAME]! I am dropping by to wish you the most fantastic day of your life! Have a good one! -HappyFriendlyBot
Hey cool! I'm a cow. I love milk. Drink a litre a day at least. Love me some moo juice.
Gorgeous. We headed to the Bob Hall pier to watch it on the beach.
I‚Äôm dying from your comment. I actually literally laughed out loud from it.
Umm, I don‚Äôt think empathy means what you think it means...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ohh that's in season I like that one
RIP. Sad for his family and the bull riding community.
You're right!
you're going to relapse in two years because you have an illness that makes you use excessive amounts of things to cope with emotions..
Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
Omg I love it
"I want my kids to feel like life will take care of them -[NAME] ""LIFE will take care of them?"" *signature [NAME] face* hahahhaha"
"Yeah I was waiting for him to coming at the end with ""Why don't you just let us do it?"" I would."
Just throw them into a pool of needles. That'll teach them not to steal ever again.
I hope your struggle is worth it. Stay strong.
I was about to say the same lol.
Dear OP: Proper punctuation please/thank you.
Agreed. The only sensible option is to throw half a fit when people disagree with you!
Biggest Welfare Queen in the world!
That‚Äôs the most intelligent question I‚Äôve ever been asked. I *could* answer it...
Nice mix of trashy and classy.
I'm not your buddy, friend. Btw, enjoy the rumble you nice dude. 
I was tripping balls my first time.
If you use one of those two I automatically hate you
Sounds epic man
That‚Äôs abuse and manipulation. She trained you well. I‚Äôve lived it, brother. 
I live an hour from one but was afraid of driving all the way there and them telling me that I have to order one.
Directly tell me why you felt the need to threaten my life.
This game and it‚Äôs updates can be very frustrating sometimes. We already discuss the issues to death but meme Monday has been oddly therapeutic
When you've been to 9 in the past 20 years its kinda hard to stiil get excited . Its our week 17.
Yeah no...I would find it very demeaning
It's certainly not one I identify with, but I find it intriguing. Hence my starting this discussion. 
I didn't think it was that bad ><
I know, pain in the asses.
You have great points. !delta
I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
Thank you for your input.
Thanks for the information!
I took a screen writing class and I think we had to do this. Then again the class was a while ago so I don't remember much
man whenever [NAME] talks i feel like a deaf person because well I just can't hear shit
Ugh. People are the worst!
Pretty torn about this post. Glad you made a friend but it sounds like you‚Äôre encouraging her habits and it‚Äôs not cool.
Saw a video on Instagram from my friend that lives in Longmont. The snow looks so pretty. Do want.
I loathe him too, but I couldn't even get on board with lynching him. Not even that obnoxious twat [NAME]
Well then take my upvote my sub soulmate. lol
It's a great town.
An Asuka reference in fatlogic?! Love it.
Me too, whenever my friends get with people I dont feel happy for them. I just feel envy and rage.
Thank you for being the only person here to choose, not to be offended. This is a good burn. 
I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I‚Äôm so glad my imagination wasn‚Äôt right.
I wish I could be half as cool as that guy
I was never a [NAME] guy, though he was CERTAINLY my 2nd choice. But I deeply love and empathize with this... 
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can run as long as one of your parents is a US citizen (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).
Im turning 30 this year. We just cant get rowdy like we used to man, i mean we *can* but damn all these responsibilities
I'm appalled that your roommate straight up destroyed perfectly good leftovers that way
Please, it'd be to stop time wasting doomed repeat VoNCs.
Seriously doubt it will be Knights of Ren, but that would certainly be a great way to get people excited and build hype.
i have this comic and I love this bit!
Boy I *sure hope* this isn't a weekly thread, how obnoxious, haha
Yeah the question makes no sense without more context.
I'm kinda the opposite. I always look dour and sad even when I'm not...
It‚Äôs been good, made me able to function much much better. 
That's exactly why I'm asking you if you would.
Beat me to it. Just because the news makes it seem like there is a pandemic of school shootings, it is exceedingly unlikely to happen.
Protip- just smell your damn food. Use your senses!
Also not true. Germany had pervasive antisemetism long before [NAME]. Ignoring that error your argument is horrible and you should be ashamed.
He‚Äôs just tired and needs to rest.
Her upper lip always looks terrible - such an easy fix, can‚Äôt believe she is so vain and never bothers to wax 
Absolutely horrible.
Trespassing in Texas and you‚Äôll get shot. I would‚Äôve shot them.
Oh she'll most probably die in that route for sure. I just hope she doesn't get a lame death, that's all
It's a genious strategy, isn't it?
I remember that one. I to found a special fondness for vacuums after that.
You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
You're not wrong
I don‚Äôt think that can happen here.
I like both.
The car analogy is silly because car problems are physical and material and hence clearly factual diagnosable. ‚ÄúToxic masculinity‚Äù is a squishy theoretical concept.
Fear of awkward and inconvenient encounters. What can he do to you?
oh, what an unlucky woman, that mother of his...
Its not just kids being kids, stop being so naive
This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,
Absolutely love this song, up there as one of my favorite fav frank songs
That will have to be MY cake then!
Thank you, kind Internet stranger.
I understand what he was trying to say, but [NAME] it came out badly.
Oh no! He‚Äôs right!
Oh wow- some truly have crazy different genetics. I‚Äôm glad you got her a friend, I‚Äôm sure it helps immensely. 
They obviously sent the funds to Binance because they didn't want them to get hacked on some shady exchange like Cryptopia.
Wow! If they were to follow that logic, they would have to ask why on earth we were given doctors! Insanity.
She took the fucking kids, huh?
[NAME] reinforces the pessimistic world view, I've been there and at least it was cancerous for me. 
That...felt good...can I cry on your shoulder?
I love it when cats go all airplane ears
Practice your speech before hand. In your head and in the physical world. Then keep doing it until it no longer scares you.
right. cause it's real. that's why she has to talk about it.
No problem People repost and don‚Äôt credit, so it‚Äôs a necessary evil Thanks for the feedback
A lot of people shit on wiki edits, but most of them give me a nice little chuckle
How much time you got? I enjoy *The Spirit of Redemption* but it's a bit long.
I suppose you would take on somebody else's terminal illness if you could. That makes you the opposite of a coward.
And there I was blaming the poor black lads
What's the point of marching for life when you don't respect those living in front of you? I'll never understand these schmucks.
There is a special place in hell for drivers like you. I pray to [NAME] there is.
Haha cheers for the kind words mate
Dude take the medicine. It helps.
Ugh gross. Don't suggest a PUA book to a kid.
fuck atheist countries
Weird flex but ok
Came here to see if i was the only one. The whole edit is one gigantic mess.
Because it has rough areas. Which near enough every city/town in the central belt has.
You bottomed out, worked, and wanted more. Feels great, doesn't it?
Because most shit right wingers say is so awful that if they said it in a space where they weren't anonymous they would be fucking done
It's very hard to un-brainwash someone. Damn near impossible
She is my friend
[NAME] has weird ideas about everything.
This is awesome! I really wish I could make it!
This is my favorite [NAME] joke I've seen
Gawd but [NAME] is a bitch.
[NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
Haha! [NAME] aside, that is *wonderful*!
My [NAME], I totally forgot about that! I really really hope he married [NAME]... They would be an amazing married couple! 
Oh interesting. I must have got in a while ago.
You spelled Nazis Propaganda wrong.
Cool post. I just wish the game had more enemies besides just the spartan and athens army (like harpies, giant snakes, something like that). 
Would love it if [NAME] showed up as church lady and played a solo on it.
Thank you so much! I love Germany! I was in Berlin 2 years ago for research work.
We like what we like.
He's a garbage person. It's very disappointing. I liked him so much before.
Fuck taking the high road. If I‚Äôm [NAME] I‚Äôm blasting the officials when I speak to the media.
I love Rocket Love and Blasted. I just wonder who the songs were written for because these are all reference tracks except Acura Intergul
>hasn't been any form of arrested development Well fuck
take care!! <3
I actually did have a girl a few towns away in a different school and no one knew her. No one believed me at first :(
I feel this but I also sympathize with mentalcels because I‚Äôm mentally ill and it makes me feel even worse.
SUFFER MORTALS!
I need to save this for hipster resistance supporters
"THE IMAGE ASKS ""WOULD YOU VIOLENCE THIS BABY IF BABY WORE HAT"" THE ANSWER IS ""NEH"""
[NAME] YES!!!
I‚Äôm not crying. Nope, no tears over here! 
I understand why... But it's so sad we have to lie... It breaks my heart...
I don't feel alive anymore. I don't feel anything. I'm just numb all over. All I know is I want it to stop
Well damn wish I could use venom too.
I don't think a player can have no value and also be worth rioting over if he's traded.
No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.
Thanks a lot
I blame [NAME] for this series of unfortunate events
Hell yeah! Don't let all the jokes get to you. You be happy being you!
THAT'S NOT HOW THIS GAME WORKS.
This joke is disgusting and offensive. Dictionaries don't contain proper nouns!
"*concussion* *Trophy system kills it* *Another concussion* *Trophy system kills it* ""Yo guys watch me throw this cluster"" Honestly embarrassing "
Oh I hate him even more now.
The House comes and goes every few years. Judges hang on until they die. Congrats on the House.
I must of not fully understood what you meant... damn tired redditing
he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl
No. We wouldn‚Äôt have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.
Edit 2, holy shit this is great. But be cautious 
I bet you‚Äôre really fun at parties.
lmao i love [NAME] what a legend somebody who really doesn't care what the public thinks i wish i could be like him
You know it‚Äôs really bad when the lashes are bigger than the brows
Couldn't have said it better myself
An indie rock guy I loved used dialectics to explain his songwriting process, it was weird.
[NAME]! Scoring ridiculous goals while missing sitters. Love it :-)
She's ugly so that might add some more months.
[NAME] rosenbrook? Is this woman mental. Why does she use these names?
Sorry but I don't keep up with YT celebs or drama What happened to [NAME] ?
So we need a jewelry store and a tv show. Bet lol
And whatever car he buys MUST have a strong Air Conditioning system. This is an absolute MUST here.
Been looking at Panthera, will take a look at RAP N. Thanks for the consideration of my big hands :D
Like I said, funny. 
It bugs me just how many people move over to be on camera
Not a doctor but I don‚Äôt think so. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen, but it doesn‚Äôt destroy lung tissue that i know of. 
Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
The new Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs looks great
Marijuana dispensary ask for thc ditalite cartridges and they might have different brands but all of them are good
[NAME]. I really loved your hustle for 35 yards. That's why it was so hard to cut you.
Don't think so. Pretty sure i tried it on the MOG 12
thank you!!
Of course I have. It‚Äôs nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now.
Sadly they aren't in control. [NAME] is and he'll always do the worst possible thing.
That is an awesome idea and execution. Also a great example of an actual free market system working right.
Peta killed a dog once, so peta is bad, so veganism is bad, so its ok to kill and eat billions of animals (including dogs)
There is something legitimately wrong with you
Shows you that one must never underestimate the rust caused by ACL injuries
Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I‚Äôm old
As Kings fans both my brother and I laughed out loud that it wasn't called. Looked sick though.
That's cool! That's definitely one way to look at itl
even the safe queen (pearl) was amazing. i would have had pearl and ginger double win
glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite
i would not want to be they guy operating the reloader while 2000RPM of 30mm shells are firing
No! Your the dumbass for leaving the keys in the car! Again DUMBASS!!!!!
I'm just happy anybody's talking to me. I'll listen again :-)
One of our favorite rides.
There is irony in what you guys are saying.
Just looked up TITANS, now I've GOT to watch it!! Thanks for the advice too
My school did this too except with a gold spray-painted plunger. Kids love toilet humor. üòé
The latter is correct.
ye but that is fucking [NAME]... there is a diffrence between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is good but he is no [NAME] ;)
No. It cannot. It's a dangerous fantasy (unironically)
This sounds familiar. But no it will be [NAME] fault. She MADE [NAME] hurt you for the greater good. /s
Thank you to share your opinion and I‚Äôll appreciate this (=
Unfortunately they do at times, but it's not the case in this video.
Thanks. I was leaning towards the 11:05 tourney at MGM since it's deeper stack and slightly longer blind levels.
Damn you two need help
I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!
Would not put too much trust on the numbers, Canadian journalists did a test on couple of these services and got different results between two identical twins.
That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
Now you tell me! I‚Äôm heading at high speed towards a one-third-life crisis and need a change.
I like how because it‚Äôs on topic you assume everyone involved is making it their entire being. Lmao.
I hate those days man... So triggering
ohh. thank you for explaining!
Also dont have to worry about ramos and robles walking in runs to lose games
Currently listening and loving it.
People on the internet take shows too seriously. The average fan is not like that
I don't see much reason for it even as a 2nd.
Stop arguing with people.
Legend! Cheers bro
I have dayz but haven‚Äôt played in years. Last I heard it‚Äôs still a broken mess lol.
I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers.
Is that the cobbler in the background of the family portrait? This is great.
I'm three months old and I love Queen and Metallica, not the crap my generstion listens too.
Lol, how much XP you get for that?
not defending [NAME] - just pointing out *one* of the reasons folks may disagree with slapping the socialist label on anyone left of neolib scum
Lol you're an idiot.
Yeah suck it, California
Yep. I‚Äôve done a couple shoots at Hornsby small bore and one clay pidgeon day at Lucas Heights.
I‚Äôm afraid it will eventually go that way.
Stupid science bitch
I'm looking forward to this way more than Captain Marvel. It's actually not even close
How can you be so stupid... it‚Äôs called climate change, there is so much research on it. It‚Äôs just blindly denying science..
Truly a beautiful story, 11/10 :')
I‚Äôve gone through it before, and it sucks. I‚Äôm still a little hazy and withdrawn.
Nowadays I get nervous watching Steelers defense. Back then, I couldn't wait to see what they'd do next.
#QUIT HURTING THE BIRDS
That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. 
[NAME] some of these post i read on this sub its just getting too ridiculous
eh, it has its ups and downs. 
Doesn't change the fact that they shadowbanned a subreddit. Just because YOU think it's stupid doesn't make that ok.
She went on a PR tour in Syria and met with him. I think it‚Äôs fair to say she‚Äôs pro-Assad.
Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.
I‚Äôd love that luxury of time.
üò¢ Happy Birthday [NAME]! She had an amazing role model growing up!
Sorry for your loss. Thoughts and prayers.
Was my friends family... They had the wrong address, you're sick dude. 
Your logo was amazing, your sushi was not.
And you don't take delight in seeing the person you love in pain. Amen my dear!
Akshon Esports do amazing and high quality content for Artifact, crazy they get so few views on their videos.
"Exactly, she wasn't ""venting"", she was abusing his fiancee. "
It's beyond evil. It is pure demonic when it's that pure sadism and vile sick torture. I hate them guys.
Heh, U.S. only has a partial government right now :/
Y‚Äôall need one of those world famous mascots. Your top at producing those.
burn the witch!
>a water molecule spends around 600 years in Lake Superior. I guess it takes a while lol
I like this
Sounds like he dodged a bullet. You‚Äôre kinda dumb.
It's the giant robot penis. Texas favorite.
Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
I use 3 different credit unions and all of them are great. Used Wells Fargo for a short while and hated them.
I have a lot of fun on pre-CU servers, but I like to grind and I love the Star Wars universe
No youre a cunt
Please stop LOOKING, and go.
I'm happy however those two don't get a ring. Would be overjoyed if it was at the hands of [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME].
I have multiple throwaways for the embarrassing or depressing things I need to get off my chest.
That's amazing!
Ahhh [NAME] its in my eye.
OMG, yep!!! That is the final answer. Thank you so much!
Hey didnt say being fat and short is bad
Good loss for the tank. [NAME] and [NAME] played really well.
">The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
Shit, I lost the original page. Please forgive me.
Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!
Awesome! I just read Bad Blood and have been waiting for a documentary about it.
Pity. I had some decent lunches there, but never went there at night.
I'm scared that they would turn out like me, even if I tried really hard to make them nice. 
But [NAME], this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream. 
Never. He cheated multiple times, and each time I had an idea before I had proof. Listen to your gut. 
would give gold if I had it haha
good to hear! I'm just gonna buy it when i'm done with my second playthrough so that i can judge Andromeda for myself
I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. ü§£
Oooo I love that theory! I hope we do find out her name one day
Much appreciated comrade!
Best side quest ever!
you fucking moron
Haha! I was right :D.
I don‚Äôt make the rules, man, I just blindly follow them like a sheep
I hope it sticks for a while. I don‚Äôt have super even skin but I can‚Äôt stand wearing foundation.
Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
Peace to you both.
I love how sly you are being
I agree. But shooting him left me feeling bad too.
oh wow, that's great news! 12 episodes of a good show always leave me on my appetite!
Yeah but even then I feel like they could‚Äôve went about it better
Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.
I don‚Äôt understand why you got a couple downvotes. I found your comment quite funny.
Thanks brother/sister. If I wasn‚Äôt so poor I‚Äôd gold you
Lol what did you type in? Cause I posted this and its entirely mine.
oh! I have more ships this time! Niice!
Foot fetish people like pretty feet. Those are not.
tyvm for this advice actually, i was totally bamboozled on this topic
What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
I want to make friends too :( but I feel like I have nothing good to offer
this is my worst fear
AWIL, great movie.
This team is so untalented.
It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
Calling people on the internet ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù... sweet [NAME] I love this sub. The cringe hurts so good.
I'd worry about traffic more than the TSA.
In my experience, yes.
Thanks for the advice, i appreciate it.
Look how pretty she is. YES QUEEN YESSSSSSS
[NAME] would be proud.
I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
No, no I'm not.
Not at all! It‚Äôs my pleasure
This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.
Me too! So pumped! Enjoy the game, bud!
First and foremost you have to Love YOURSELF!!
And if you ever make a fat cop joke on reddit then you're the worst criminal of all!
I know to you Professor, break time is nothing. But to me, it's serious.
I like that they have a red light camera there to combat the red light runners. You can see it flash twice at 0:48.
Ah yes thank u, now the image is very funny
This guy's an idiot lol
> [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
They do it way more often than you do and they give even less of a fuck. It's normal.
Because killing people is wrong?
I did misread i saw 23-27
[NAME] Almighty. This may be the most empathetic and compassionate reddit thread I've ever seen! Who ever said drunks were mean? Terrible stereotype.
The dense stuff isn't very accessible. :/
At first view, I thought it was a beer mug seen from above but immediately saw it's a pancake and now I'm just feeling dipshit.
Nah, I knock on the door from inside, or the wall, or tap the floor, seems easier
Good luck to you! Also good job for standing up for yourself
TY for the encouragement! ‚ù§Ô∏è
[NAME], that fucking sucks.
A hatred for loot boxes and a desire to get them banned was quite popular on Reddit.
Please tell me you were buying something extremely embarassing!
[NAME] was the worst Of any sports team Unis!!!
Not gonna happen, pure delusion I *aggressively* call this ridiculous bluff
I don‚Äôt think there is mouse and keyboard support yet
It‚Äôs nice to know that no one cares enough to send me either.
The like is the worst of the bunch
>fail at reading comprehension >Other guy must be a troll ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
> traffic through there in the summer is awful because that‚Äôs where everyone wants to be. your life starts to revolve around bridge time.
[NAME] is garbage in every single game he plays. He needs to be traded
Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard
I didnt see a ref's hand up, I was about to have a stroke
Desperation is unattractive, stop being so desperate. Love yourself before you can love someone else.
[NAME] damn I love Coops
It's all out of love... We promise.
Damn that was super fucking good.
Now defeat your dragons and clean your room.
Your mother is an idiot. If she somehow proved that you were an unfit parent to your children your stbx husband would get them not her.
Wtf did I just read? That was painful
That pizza looks good
Lmao, okay little buddy. Have a nice day. 
This is how Dayz is meant to be, very nice story!
I dated a girl once who made a gb with her cup holder. Dropped my phone in it once
Now you‚Äôre reddit staking me? Don‚Äôt comment on my stuff dude.. gtfoh
Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.
Lovely. This is a good deed and he should be lauded for it despite whatever else is going on around him.
How dare the russian government expose the DNC and its corrupt behavior!!!!!
My 8 year old niece enjoys them. 12 year old nephew thinks they're brilliant though :)
They‚Äôre not pissed off to the point where they‚Äôre actually going anywhere else, and that‚Äôs just crunching numbers.
The chubby one scurrying away against the baseboards has me cracking up. Typical hamster.
Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
Shhh don't give them the idea!
You have been banned from the mickey mouse clubhouse for inappropriate behavior
SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE OR I WILL HACK YOUR REDDIT ACCOUNT!!!!!!
[NAME] is great, I love [NAME] content as well.
The last book feels like a dream. It's ridiculously bad, imo 
Wait... I have been in two movies and I have played [NAME] in both.
Anything to do with Iceland and Scandinavia has to be rad!
"Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "
I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some.
You really don't allow children to come forward with bullying until they have video evidence? Lmfao
I do hate fortnite dances
Looks deliriously boring.
Irrational anger especially certain family members
All good brother
I‚Äôll miss you, [NAME] Today is a sad day for our high sock loving brethren [NAME]
Be good-looking.
I love [NAME] as a player. I still think the best is yet to come with him. Just praying he stays on the field.
There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate.
Have fun in the farmer's league.
Thanks so much for the precious advice, that is very helpful!
Icing on a cake of sadness.
I dont know, she seems pretty gangster to me.
i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( 
That's unfortunate but can't blame that lawyer for doing his job.
Keeping the stomach warm also helps. Holding the baby with their stomach against yours helps them fall asleep. But it doesn't work all the time unfortunately.
Funny I‚Äôm on my second play through and this happens...
Uh...no
No problem! I was upset I couldn‚Äôt chose a female rose grey bay Arabian in story mode. I wanted to name her Ros√©
My wife is going to hate me for laughing my ass of when I tell her this later. Worth it!
Lmfao I'm not here to Google easy shit for morons.
Good Luck at the SuperBowl [NAME]!
You're a great dad.
Congrats to you!! My husband went from being like your husband... to processing cannabis oil. There is hope.
We really need to sign a new CB now with [NAME] out injured. [NAME] isn't good enough yet.
I found some very interesting things on the mind shock podcasts about questions I had. Enjoy the digging in the reddit hole.
yeah, i believe thats the only moving part in the whole device.
This wasn't exactly aimed at the national brain trust.
Okogie looks like a freaking beast compared to the rest, maybe not Ayton. His shoulders are bigger than his head haha.
don‚Äôt curse mmeEEEE !
Why did she get married if she did not love him? Aren't you afraid the same thing wil happen to you?
Why don't you just move to secular country like North Korea, China or Sweden? Leave theists alone we don't want you.
She liked the bumper sticker so much she decided to get it for herself
Fuck your opinion apparently
Good work if true!
She'll probably never be seen again, I fear. Thanks for reminding me of her name.
I hope [NAME] likes my Thanos costume though.
A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
You're attractive. I would shag you. Worcester isn't too far from Derbyshire haha
Too bad I do/
Really that's not very sad at all
Love the cheese!
The picture in the thumbnail looks like the kids in the maga hat that fucked with the native [NAME]
If it were [NAME] being negative about Korea, would you be equally happy to see it banished?
They also almost always miss, leading to that awful thin sheet of bagel that ends up as ash in the oven. 
I agree I think they hyped it up
I‚Äôm glad you do feel genuine, unconditional love for your own child :,)
Mate you are mental, no way [NAME] would mess up like you have said!
That‚Äôs a very precious word from [NAME].
This is great in contrast to the [NAME] and [NAME] drama
And then the oligarchs in charge will be forced to say how they really feel about America... this bizarre logic has very interesting potential.
 No way, man. We're gonna keep on rockin' forever. Forever. Forever. Forever...
And even then... It won't be for long.
No. These are the people who loved someone with BPD, but got used/abused/abandoned by them. It's mostly romantic relationships. Family tends to be on r/raisedbyborderlines. 
Same. But the 21 point lead drew me in.......who knew you can lose by double digits leading by that much.
That sounds kinda crazy. I bet you voted for [NAME]
I don't know how everyone is falling for this lmao. Cringing a bit.
Fact, the sky is orange. And if you think it‚Äôs blue, you‚Äôre stupid
The way that ladder is attached to the building is pretty terrible.
This country is an absolute shithole. Our police are no better than the filth they should be catching!
Everyone is fed up of it, but it'll be over soon and we'll be glad of it then. Just like the Newlands Cross flyover.
Sadly no, but I hear it comes with a sweet bottle opener! And you can't spell Bottle Opener without Lebron.
I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!
Can‚Äôt wait to try this out
No kids? Who cares. Go your separate ways.
This is how my SO gaslights me. I hope it goes well when he comes home and good luck with the baby!
That‚Äôs the hardest part for some to get over, but hobbies help and getting yourself up and out of the house and spending time with friends
Yeah. Hard not to catch feelings sometimes, even if they are just a bunch of writeoffs.
Wow wish I could take that. That is an absolute steal. Not a lock by any means but value alone is worth it
Too bad that's not the case. I'm happy I'll one day die.
I will definitely check that artist out, if there is something that can lift me up a little bit, it's new music. 
That does suck. I‚Äôm sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it‚Äôs a terrible feeling
I'd love it if we actually rotated instead of running players into the ground.
Lol, same! Except that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder
They look absolutely PERFECT together. I hope its that way in real life too. So happy for ya [NAME]!!!
Ah. I thought you meant ads in general. Sorry, bud! 
Thank you. I saves your comment, to buy this book when I get outta the field
Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
Thanks. I knew DH, but that one was confusing me.
Why would anyone forget how dominant he is? Lmao Oh yea we suck.
i definitely remember the times i embarassed myself or regrettable actions i made from years ago
For me it is easier to believe that the Big Bang occurred via a natural process than through an external agent such as some god.
I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
>as a part-time Knicks fan Join us! Become a full-time Nuggs fan!
He‚Äôs still a handsome fella, imo. ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The cult of reason was very unreasonable. :D
Yeah I love all of my little rejects. They keep my wife warm when I've got a night shift.
Lol. Go astroturf r/politics. We aint buying her leftist bs here
does any body notice that 8 in 2018 looks weird
This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.
He‚Äôs too old for [NAME]
I have no shame to say I know the dances and most of the live shows. SHE IS MY QUEEN
11 years goddamit I‚Äôm old
[NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
In heaven that's the only thing that's going on. All the angels and human souls sing [NAME] praises forever.
Lol. That too
Can we put down weed bro? He‚Äôs faced too much suffering.
It goes that far back? That was probably hands down the best fight ever. I loved stone cold as a kid
Think about how many times OP has jerked it into those sheets
How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].
It goes away and can be treated. Once treated it would never return until she had another child.
Please cut her off from your life. You don‚Äôt need to deal with this behaviour. Be safe and please take care.
I honestly can't tell if he really doesn't care or if he's just soft af... or maybe both lol
Not having sex doesn't mean you can't talk about it especially if the ultimate goal is proper coexistence.
That'd be amazing! Heard about Newington's reno not long ago. Need to get over there.
Their Cinnamon Chip Bread is also quite good.
MRW someone asks me what that new annoying app that's always advertising on Youtube is.
My greatest fears are getting wooshed and not getting the joke.
My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes 
Wow I‚Äôve never seen that one and I love it! Could you share the picture?
Common sence isnt that common any more
Saw bad guy, arrested same.
At least you can admit you missed it
I crave nuts and nut butter all üëè the üëè damn üëè time. I think my body know they‚Äôre calorie and nutrient dense üòÇ
Stop. How can you watch [NAME] these past years and think he has 2-3 years left.
He said he says it on his own but I don't want him to say it at all. I feel like their bio mom hates me
This...has 9k upvotes. Wow.
Yeah, the robber in my comment was also 'emotionally attached' is what I meant. I don't get what your comment means lol. 
If you'd like to suggest an alternative non-inflammatory metaphor for something that implies racism, I'm happy to consider it. 
That's what I was talking about. Eat one meal, then hibernate until you're so hungry you gotta eat again.
Thank you!! Every time I see someone say ‚Äúwith one exception‚Äù I‚Äôm like nooo! It‚Äôs a song too!!
NO BOY! NO MORE FREEDOMS TO GO AROUND HERE! Now go back to your room and give me your toy guns immediately
‚ÄòMy Goddess went to prison and all I got was this crappy t-shirt‚Äô
Ah yes, my apologies!
We are going with Godsey. This team is so dumb.
The incorrect number of O's has depressed me
I regret that I have but one downvote to give.
It‚Äôs counterfeit. Just morally wrong.
God. Damnit. Ever since HS hockey players have been my fetish... This is almost too much...
Lmao good luck tryna convince anyone you‚Äôre not just a brain washed redpiller tryna start shit just for validation :/
It‚Äôs perfect!
Safety Dance in Naxxramas, WOTLK. My favorite boss fight to date
Close game but glad to see we came back in the end
Looks very dry
Oh look another shit call
You sound scared
i would not vote for him
Thank you very much for the advice I didn't really have anywhere else to turn
I like [NAME]
That was so disgusting. VWP
Pretty much, it‚Äôs ironic to think how quickly the parties would switch positions if the illegal immigrants were expected to vote 90% for [NAME].
i wouldn‚Äôt want to fight me neither
[NAME] lives. Obviously you can quote me on that, because i just said it. [NAME] dies. [NAME] dies. Fuck [NAME]. 
In foreign policy terms we're no better than Russia. We're guilty of everything they are.
I had to mute cause the sound was making me cry.
i wish i could wear what she's wearing! * _ * Sooooo beautiful!
"My daughter loves this! She's taking a bath rn singing ""fiire"""
Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.
Neither of them looked good in the grimes beef lol
I would say you‚Äôll be fine just drink water and maybe run/sweat a few times before your drug test!
Hooray for the cancer! /s
Dude that was in like October abandon all hope
"The 5 days got an audible ""[NAME]"" out of me. That's terrifying. "
[NAME] here...that guac looks horrible
Guess we don't need to be afraid of hell, then, 'cause we can easily get out.
"Sounds like another data point for ""fear homo Sapiens"", haha. "
Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all.
This offense is just painful to watch.
"its admittedly shallow and petty but I love the saying ""libertarianism is astrology for men"""
"When the etiquette ""shitpost"" is 100% accurate"
This is good for people who pilots as well and rely on Tablets or phones for mapping
>Dude, nobody reads. That is *really* not true. 
Luckily you can see the Big 5 within about 45 minutes from Joburg, so get the car and Google some activities. Loads of fun to be had. 
ah, rejection. i know something about it
That was a fluid motion and it scared me
That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
Come on. Foul or not, that was a great move
Not quite no. I don't pay attention to the leaks so I can't judge their quality.
Of course it is. If it's called #bellletstalk. Not #letstalk.
It shouldn't be, I feel like that's happened to us many times! 
I laughed so hard.
[NAME] is a cute woman, A Shyster, but cute.
$11 an hour doesn't leave a lot of room to be a hero.
You made yourself useless playing their game instead of forcing them to play to your strengths
Instinct and Intellect are opposites, never said they were the same
No wonder I can not use my Visa card in China. [NAME] is doing the right things. China must stop its unfair business practices.
Thank you for at least doing something good sir.
You see, when a router and a hard drive love each other very much...
I don't care for [NAME] but I still love this. Like it or not, he represents us.
Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it.
I'm not really interested in collecting them but I do enjoy watching videos of people who restore old hotwheels.
I appreciate this post, so it‚Äôs appropriate in my eyes üòÄ
FUCK, THANKS!
I‚Äôd say this is spot on. He‚Äôs not sorry he hurt me. He just wants me to shut up.
True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams.
Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.
Man, I miss those days. LA is pretty much dead now.
The next [NAME]. Welcome [NAME].
Not offended just dont care to debate over game development or how long it takes ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol you win sir
True, I am not a fan of [NAME] or anyone really. I did not mean to make so many people mad.
LPT for controversial thing use bing. They dont filter as muchas google.
Gotta love January.
I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
sorry im deaf i can‚Äôt hear you
These rich fucking senators are completely out of touch with reality. Eat. The. Rich.
Underaged drinking in Wisconsin... get out no way!!!
I don't even know how to begin explaining something this preposterously self-evident to you, so I'm just not going to. 
If they want the situation to escalate, they may just keep nagging me and wait for things to tip over.
Wish he'd upload more üò™
They won VEGAS not the PRO LEAGUE QUALIFIER. Stop trying to bait me
Because bullying is a way to enforce social conformity, and discourage people from being different. 
This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
As every politics expert knows, there's an eternal struggle between The Holy Roman Empire and Nazis. 
Yup those are the two worst tasting out of my cocktail!
[NAME] looks hot in her 70‚Äôs outfit.
So...... SOOOOOOOOOO glad Atlanta came back and beat the Bucs. Because of it, my beloved [NAME] are coming to Tampa.
Justice for that horrendous no call
My husband‚Äôs mental health issues caused our divorce. If you need a friend or a listening ear, pm me. I hope things improve!
Y'all taking this way too seriously...the point is they're both fierce.
Well, that was dumb.
[NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck
We all saw it, my American friend. Now go and fix your government.
"Sure glad I wasn't coming the other way when this twatwaffle decided to try his ""watch this sick drift, yo"" stunt."
I‚Äôm glad you did
Those ads actually make me feel bad for financial advisors gouging clients with excessive fees.
You all treat him like shit so what do you expect?
I hate that attitude, as if it's every woman's, purpose, dream, and personal duty to reproduce.
You look adorable. :) I love your eyes. :)
No but I will now. Thanks!
No it was a joke
I'm rank 6 and get destroyed for using legion, what build do you use? I absolutely love legion just here getting ran over
Thats fair. I know its a joke it just always struck me as odd how people wrote it off. No worries.
Never ceases to boggle my mind how truly ignorant some people are.
The one in WA state. For some reason Vancouver BC is really close to Vancouver WA. It's weird
That head must hurt!
1.0mg is a high dose. My husband is an insomniac and can't take that dose without nightmares.
WHO WAS DRAAAAAAGED DOOOOOOOWN BYYY THE STOOOOOONE
Looks nice, thanks:) 
You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.
its disgusting where our society is. free tube sites need to be banned
I imagined as much, but I wasn‚Äôt sure, thanks for the clarification.
I think that's a minority, not the majority there.
I actually find running harder than passing on all madden
It won't matter how you explain it. He's cruel and insensitive and doesn't care about how you feel.
Hah. Thanks!
Honestly, the fact that they're over and done didn't truly hit me until I saw that they now have a Greatest Hits album.
Well I'm not to sure what country your from but my school has started integrating more modern views and it isn't all black and white anymore
Disney World/Land or NYE at Time's Square have always made me nervous.
Can't wait to die so I won't have to hear [NAME] breath in my ears 100 years from now.
Was hilarious. RIP Roman
Socially it's completely unacceptable to pee your pants.
I mean I'm no fan of the series either but who cares? It makes a lot of people happy.
Awesome me too, can't wait.
I want my fucking cake back.
No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
I am in hysterics. How are these people so serious?
Indeed. I've had an eye removed and what you described is accurate.
Huh, I'd missed this one when looking for new games a few months back. Might have to give it a try.
Unfortunately this is just as illegal as impeding traffic all over the city.
I'm upset that there's no sexual subtext between [NAME] and [NAME] in the new Super Mario game
fantastic point!
the sky, living a happy and amazing life in the clouds.
Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. 
I got sort of excited and really was hoping it was [NAME]. Obviously it's not.... so yey... mystero.
I‚Äôm not high and that sounds like a good sandwich.
Then when you dropped them that was it for youth group cred for the night. Lol
Thats great! Just curious, what game? 
Thank you brother
lmao i just laughed so hard at this, screw yates
Please don‚Äôt marry this man-child.
It's simple, he's blunt, and that is what some people need.
Studid fuckin idiot
you don‚Äôt appreciate the good times till you go through the bad.. things will get better OP, stay strong
jeeez i've never seen a scorpion so bad it actually flipped the person up right
I love that whoever was filming zoomed in knowing what was about to happen. [NAME]
Thank you TC for getting us to 100!
being reminded of that blessed image now makes me hope they won't do the whole no bipod on your back thing rip my homie franku
Nope I‚Äôm not exposing my kinks to Reddit üòÇ
Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
It's definitely that
Because we feed the shitty ones so there is no incentive to put in effort
Oh. My. [NAME]. I can‚Äôt handle this
Weird way to type YYYY-MM-DD
See i hate [NAME] and got my ass kicked that game bc i couldnt use him so i was lime why me üòÇ
Nostalgia is the best high. You get to enjoy what you liked with several cool new perspectives.
">""fun"" is what you say when you can't give an objective reason something is good. -r/movies Film√© connoisseur"
OHHHH, I like where Richmond is going with that.
I hated that smug ass lawyer.
Death approaches! -[NAME] 2013 (I think)
[NAME]... Nice
[NAME] forced [NAME] to give it up, leading to a steal, and then gets a steal himself on the next play. Love his tenacity.
Me and friends just got Vermintide 2, and it isn't an MMO but it solves a lot of MMO problems we had. Quite fun so far.
I've said it before, but yuck, kissing that bloody mouth... Watch out, [NAME], you don't know where that's been.
Ah what a good start
Insipid shite so far. We look mid-table.
Sorry to hear that, I hope you're doing better now.
I'm fairly sure alpro have what you're looking for
I miss big daddy buff
One of the podcasts I listen to, pump talks, bought one from [NAME] for a girls birthday and apparently it was very sweet! 
Maybe I‚Äôm out of touch, but I see 22-14-6 and think that is typically a playoff caliber record.
[NAME] is one of my favorite non dodger players, he‚Äôd make a great addition to the dodgers, hope they push for him 
yes, please do I'm worried about her D:
No problem at all, glad I could help :) Cheers!
I like your colour choices and I can feel your love of the city. Keep up the art! Sending you lots of love and healing.
Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.
Yeah exactly man haha. Not just that core is bad but hc is always more fun imo
I love this guy. He does amazing impersonations. Thanks for sharing.
Capitalism coerces all of us into exchanging labor for money. Respect all hustles of non harmful types! üôåüèª
I hope for his sake his name isn't on it. It would be much simpler legally if it isn't.
Well yeah, you've gotta paint it white yourselves
Translation: you should see her vagina! She can't fight you off! The double entendre is more than a bit unsavory.
It's like Guatemala, but instead of the US it's Mexico... disgusting 
What a loon
Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.
I feel digestive regret just looking at them.
That is not a law. It's a freaking poem that someone decided to write.
This comment has been removed for breaking rule #8.
I wish that laugh would jump off
I'm 25 and I still don't have a license. I'm terrified of driving and get anxiety every time I'm behind the wheel.
That's awesome! Thanks for sharing the event!
[NAME] will be gone. Although I think end of the first is where he should go, he will go super early
Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.
I'd love for some kind of throwback jersey game with [NAME] wearing the old-style goalie cage mask ala [NAME].
I just get sad when I see people commenting on articles and videos about him that they think he's on drugs.
I am just saying that it makes no sense in Russian
[NAME] is nowhere close to the worst linebacker in the league.
Good for you! So awesome!
In such a situation, I would save the mother. Always.
Never seen somebody project so hard in my LIFE Also [NAME] @ them directly quoting lines from the article in the comments Gives me r/iamverysmart vibes
The diagonal photo is killing me. Why is it like that?
1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR 
FUCKING YES BEST PLAYER ON THE PITCH TODAY ABSOLUTE WARRIOR BOW DOWN TO THE BALON DOR WINNER TRULY WORTHY
Also [NAME] raised money because so many of his subscribers are dumb enough to confuse an Indian company with the country of India.
Yeah, It's just difficult to resist the lure of the dark side.
At least she had a great experience
Huh, I was just wondering if something like this existed. I'm working in food manafacturing an this would be epic.
It was very good! Not a musical fan but it was pretty entertaining.
Ooooooo that burns!!! üî•üî• ü§£ This is amazing.
Haha colluded? Do you and your friends collude to take pictures together? Such buzzwords you are using lol
True dat. I‚Äôm an AFC guy, but I‚Äôm even more an AFC West guy. Send the [NAME] home, Chefs!
No spelling and grammar errors. Oh my [NAME] better than the other repost.
I would like that.
Orisa will actually fair better than most if the orisa has good fortify usage. Mainly decreases effectiveness for dva and rein.
Is the wooosh on us cause there‚Äôs no fuckin wooosh to begin with or
Dude you need some help...
Too bad we couldn't elect a good leader in 2016...instead we got a bum. Oh well, [NAME] is finished. [NAME] 2020 
So it may be occasionally a little more time, I heard their juice is A+ quality at a great price.
His interviews are so awkward
I have a bad feeling about this.
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find a way and a time that works for you, you deserve to be yourself!
I love military films, this was good. My theater was clapping when each terrorist got killed lol
wow that‚Äôs really some hate there. I hated [NAME] in the Office too, but he got okay since the third run
Way to tongue punch that fart box. üëç
I hope Thier friends now
Wow that‚Äôs a fascinating belief
Generally, yes. That doesn‚Äôt make being attractive necessary criteria for being successful and it doesn‚Äôt detract from any of your positive qualities
I have insomnia too thanks for the recommendation, always on the look out for helpful podcasts and meditations 
Crush. Big crush. Still have it.
A new mattress if you can swing it. Company provided mattresses are typically pretty garbage.
Ace ventura is a fantastic film outside the extreme transphobia
Shotgun rack? LOL. I had a BB gun rack on my Schwinn in the 60s in Houston.
Wow... Hope you ok and good luck
Thank goodness for that!
No, it's not. If they grow in the wrong way then they can become extremely painful and cause discomfort. People usually like chewing freely
Mate, you're proving my point.
Thanks!
[NAME]* I'm not mad, just dissapointed.
If it's anything like what happened in France, I'd assume because it disproportionately affects the poor. 
Don‚Äôt ever apologize for calling it that. The Beach is a [NAME] movie, not a Toronto neighbourhood. 
Valium/Diazepam is much much more enjoyable than Alprazolam/Xanax IMO. I love the muscle relaxation. It feels so good, combined with an opiate, 
That says to me that he believes you are the issue, not his mother.
Would breaking her jaw and hands be out of line? She couldn‚Äôt call or text, what a shame. 
I find it funny the same people obsessed with ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù call others ‚Äúintellectually bankrupt‚Äù
Thanks! Oddly enough, it's actually the first place that I ate at, when I was apartment hunting in New Haven several years back.
A little too nutty for me thx.
Oh yes the dreaded Sabres second period:(. I hope they win tonight.
Okay, enough me being a great mom.
You are a unique woman. Happy for you that you found someone who suits you so well.
Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
Looks like you've never been to Paris! The worst toilet in UK is cleaner than Paris.
I should have known what awaits behind the oilymama hashtag and yet I searched. Now I‚Äôm sad.
My bad, sorry. I kicked a pebble on top of that mountain.
"""It's not true!!! But I DETEST [NAME]!! Reddit help meeee!!!"""
I like the mountain of health and guts thing about shugoki. Wouldn't mind if he get even more health
Thank you! It has its perks, but sometimes I do think to myself that I‚Äôm not where I belong haha
I'll miss the podcast
My all time favorite band!!! Now my son listens to them and [NAME]!
I didn't see anything in that comment referring to a cactus.
Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for ‚Ç¨149. $500 is insane!
I often send my female friends Love poems. Oh wait, no, no I don't, because that is super weird. 
GF is false; I saw Mayor get transported and I was stabbed by an SK
I love this drink.GIF
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs the smallest things that take up the biggest part of our hearts.
Appreciate the love man!! It's a fun game!
Did you know that [NAME] got shot in the head while shooting AND HE KEPT ACTING
I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!
Omg I did the same exact thing LOL
I think they were hoping he would be the [NAME], that didn't happen.
Weird how he doesn't have to say the word review in order to spend the entire article reviewing
How is anyone so stupid to not vaccinate their child?
Not a chance on this
Well that just sounds delightful. Where was the exchange?
It‚Äôs still not working unfortunately :(, you have a link to your YT?
this study is bull but only cos my waist is just 2 inches larger than my head and im still dumb as hell
Just wanna say I love you and hope the flight and everything thing else goes wellüëåüëå.
Really rude move to do that in the rest room though.
This is actually a really good idea
This is like the third repost of this. But yes, very sad indeed.
Voting for someone to tax you to death makes no sense
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing lol but it‚Äôs one of my favorite maps and blood isn‚Äôt up to snuff with it
That seems real terrible, does that actually work? Negs should usually be playful at worst. 
That‚Äôs so cool! I can‚Äôt wait to see when it‚Äôs finished!
The app trio is the only thing worthwhile there. Won ton tacos +boneless wings + spinach dip and I'm a happy camper.
For her? Nah
I felt my heart drop. [NAME].
Oh well, you can thank all the illegals coming into America illegally for that one. 
And? Did i say they didnt? Read the whole thread you bimbo
Don‚Äôt think there is a single person that thinks he overreacted there
Sad part is there‚Äôs Flames fans that think this is true
Trolls are not even trying anymore. Im offended by this half arsed attempt to get a rise out of me..
...says the opioid addicted narcissist with multiple untreated physical and psychological ailments and is completely unable to work with anyone but his own clone.
Grammar guy, sorry, but vicarious doesn't work like that. Did you mean various? 
Disclaimer: This is r/television not r/news. Sorry for the mistake.
Wow....while I think I knew this already, I can't quite picture it. I'ma have to go rewatch those scenes. 
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
I mean, to be fair... She did say sorry. /s
You're a big man
She would be devastated! Whatever you're going through won't last forever... this will pass!! Ask for help - find someone to talk to!
Either way, I am afraid his marriage is over. She doesn't respect him anymore...
Ahaha alright. Im done. Peace man good luck with everything :)
The Tommy Gun as a crate weapon! Just the worst feeling.
Wow, for some reason this made me really uncomfortable
hmm... we don't need [NAME] now, we need ball retention
Those are female toes. Busted!
Nice try my guy.
Is it though? All the highschoolers I knew were too broke to be using juuls. Everyone had a suorin and the only ones with juuls were drug dealers.
If I wasn't destitute I would give you gold. I humbly offer my upvote.
And then everyone clapped and cheered.
Weird flex but ok
Clear disregard for the Turf Protection Act:
This guy died on the inside lol
Doesn‚Äôt frustrate me at all. He‚Äôs not worth the asking price. Plain and simple.
I just want the last couple [NAME] nerfs rolled back, she's still good but not as fun. 
Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
That awkward moment when you fully embrace misogyny but believe homophobia is wrong.
Damn it, karen
Yeah I‚Äôd love a before and after!
It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.
Rename yours to Fuck and let alphabetical order take care of the rest.
Saw them at a free concert on my campus in 2012. They were good.
Bahaha I love that
It‚Äôs the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.
It really is! I loved everything about it. I'm so happy my friend told me about the franchise :)
We really need to go on some sort of winning streak
Burkina Faso is 1,000 miles of the Sahara away from Libya. Also, congratulations on embracing the sunk cost fallacy so completely.
[NAME] can stuff it, but I‚Äôll take the disengagement from the Administration for what it is.
I thought I couldn't get more depressed about last game, but.....
you can't damage anything other than on foot players right now, no turrets, no vehicles, no objectives, it has been bugged since the december update
it's kinda cute
I remember a countdown for when the [NAME] twins turned 18 too. Thought it was pretty gross.
Ugh I am in this same place right now. Dating a husband whose wife calls all the shots. I feel for you.
Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. 
I was in the top 3 on solo and lost solely due to buddy having 2 concussions.
Damn that coyote was a fucking noob.
Nobody will ever dethrone nurses and teachers, but hotel employees are quietly becoming some of the weirdest people in my Tinder matches.
Well this is inappropriate
[NAME], we have a guy with a bucket on his head and you have pornstars. I‚Äôm glad I live on this side of the Atlantic 
I keep giggling cause I‚Äôm imagining them fitting together like a puzzle...
Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
Sorry, I was misinformed. My apologies, brother in [NAME].
You know he humps the hell out of that thing right? Like probably right in [NAME] mouth!
These stupid fucking cunts don‚Äôt even use ‚Äúshade‚Äù correctly, [NAME] would toss them off the pier.
No compromise, the Democrats are finally showing some goddamn backbone. 
Not really sweaty palms, but holy hell that's uncomfortable as all hell...
I wanna see [NAME] too at the ASG too!! He gotta show that [NAME] Magic with [NAME] as teammate
We can work on both. Ignore centrists who want to pretend that we have to choose.
Lol love that [NAME] and [NAME] are both [NAME]. And [NAME] as [NAME] is best choice. Should have brought puddy in though. Hah
I agree. I‚Äôd rather spend $500 a ticket to go to MetLife and watch it on the big screen with 75,000 other Jets fans.
Nobody likes you
This is the worst advice I've ever read. You should be ashamed for posting it.
I never thought it was at the same moment, but sometimes after [NAME] sacrifice... sounds logical
I had a friend who got cussed out hardcore because his last name was [NAME] ‚Äúkoons‚Äù...and that was his exact response lol
believe me, it almost did for me. if i was a woman my panties would have dropped instantly. lol
Thanks for sharing! I loved [NAME] interview too haha. Looking forward to his on-court reunion with [NAME].
Glad to share knowledge and you‚Äôre welcome. > father for [RELIGION] Didn‚Äôt understand this statement of yours!?
lol, Cause everyone knows that you lean on the Bow. What bow skin is that?
Lifesite ‚ÄúNews‚Äù doxxed him. That website is just pure hatred distilled, it‚Äôs disgusting.
Thank you anyway! I‚Äôm 30 and I don‚Äôt get a lot of these things.
Then enjoy it for as long as it's fun. When it stops being fun, go find somebody else.
Hilarious video, thank you for making us smile :)
Thanks man I appreciate that! I just feel like I'm in a tailspin of not being good enough and idk how to get out of it
> I didn't know that. That's a perfect solution. Thank you!!
haha good one friend real neato joke!!!!
Man, dropping is rather dreadful but nothing‚Äôs more dreadful when you can reach into your pockets expecting it to be there and it isn‚Äôt 
Sell all bch for bitcoin and hope for a bull run. Best decision you probably will make in your life.
No, it's a back massage at best. At worst it can give you a stroke and kill you.
Thanks, this means a lot! I will do don't worry :)
This is terrible
Excellent! I hope that EU countries will issue statements of support themselves too, soon. Prime opportunity to really piss into Russias breakfast for once.
Indeed yet I still gotta watch my dependency & tolerance. I stay disciplined and just keep moving forward.
Ok. Thanks
Oh, the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!!
and everyone else is worried about themselves not paying attention to you
Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
Man a 29 year old broner can't beat a 40 year old pressure fighter, broner sucks 
Such pretty kitties!
>If you were to confiscate $900 billion of [NAME] assets, lmao
that was clearly only one pump, bad call
If your enjoying your time with the other person then you are always on fun dates.
Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS.
Appreciate the update, hope this one is the right one though ! 
Exactly what I came here to write lol
Good luck with ur sales. Get an ig page going and backpack off thugpug hashtags. Be a lot easier then on here.
I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
True but stranger things have happened.
What a buttnoodle. Glad that ‚Äútheir‚Äù cat has a new family and that takes care of them. Thanks for sharing!
Lol they‚Äôre in for a big surprise.. does anyone know how TIMs will actually age?
The leaders are quite ignorant, and so are the rural areas, but the urban areas are filled with intelligent people
Oh thank [NAME] another commercial break. I was missing all these repeated, terrible ads
She got the death penalty...? fck me.
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
> I refuse to believe facts
what are you scared of!
Yup, lost a whole train station inside of their houses. Great loss 
No friends anymore, but had a guy get jealous at another guy flirting with me.
It should go well with kratom anyway. I need to just eliminate anxiety and not have cravings
This isn't uplifting. This is *enraging*. This is what the government should be doing not nine-year-old fucking children.
Omg like I get so moody when I'm hungry lol im so bipolar Yyyeeaaahhhh...
 And not all children's hospitals need the same stuff, so call and ask what they need. But I like your tip. You're correct. 
Yeah I would regularly find Steelers Fans. Dunno if that demographics been changed. Oh yeah we have a lot of Cowboy fans too.
Exactly! How dare we give those people shade!
It's pretty clear if you understand basic math.
And then they clapped and gave you $100, I'm sure
Damn I didn't realize we just locked up the season series against the jets. That's good to see.
Yes no one wants to believe my religion and how to make people happy so it makes me sad
True , when this song started playing, I got my first ‚Äú Gone Fishing‚Äù signature. Loved that game. Thanks for sharing.
Well then I feel sorry for men for being such incontrolable sexual beasts I guess. My original answer was sincere, I can't speak for others though.
Saame god I try to picture myself as a more attractive version of myself if that makes sense but it's all just fantasy :(.
80 minutes too late
Sorry for your loss mate
Lol the guy in white who just leans back and looks away when he gets [NAME] ass in his face
Thank you, have never been to a church and couldn‚Äôt have know it is called a pew.
that is not a life PRO tip, that is a life ROOKIE tip
awful vehicle physics that cause you to instantly die when hitting small bumps and certain angles! WHY!
Lmao god damn
Nah I didn‚Äôt get scammed but my money is sitting in the Dream Market escrow doohickey. Whatever that means! Haha!
Creepiest building in Chicago. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine the number of gunshot victims that have gone theough those doors and came out in a body bag.
I like the Call Her Daddy Girls and I don‚Äôt care who knows it
I would love to find a like minded boyfriend but I given up on that already...
I feel your pain üò™ i got scammed $1400 in November. I felt like a dumbass for falling for it too.
Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)
You‚Äôre an awful troll...
[NAME] cares like a father incredible
I stopped worrying about showing vulnerability years ago but there's still nobody there.
How poignant.
Sometimes life actually hands you lemons. We're just lucky that we have a proverbial phrase that gives us an idea of what we can do with them.
Oh but that was like a positive love story. It didn‚Äôt really showcase all the problems with online dating.
For the [NAME] I always love our deep ACC Tourney runs. I‚Äôd love a regular season championship though
Velvet Taco, and it is amazing.
They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people.
I think there is something odd about it too... We will probably get the truth it the not to distant future, but no one will care. 
They will be once enough young progressives have replaced the older centrists :) Welcome to the new Democratic Party!
That is great insight. Once mom is against you, you‚Äôre done. 
The social cohesion after brexit is going to be super cool too, everyone with flags on the windows.
Every time one of our players enter top form they get injured.
lol, I thought he might have been heading towards that direction with that too.
"Very tired us can attendant: ""here are your vagina slimes."" ... thankfully the customer just laughed kt off."
volunteer as tribute first, we need an example that we can follow :)
"You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
I'm nauseous
The best part about this is that everyone was trolled from Fox to the Mary Shitbag
ü§£that is so cool
Shame Saints aren't even going to get a LBP out of this game, feels like that's the minimum deserved
Even with their new location around the corner, they are still incredibly awful. By far the worst [NAME]. 
I wish my mom was like you. Moms like her make us feel like our whole life has just been an identity crisis.
Damn. And loosing all Progress on the first Char ?
Oh no I didn‚Äôt see that episode!? She pooped in the car?!
you are my inspiration, read my last post quickly!
Thanks? Lol. Pairing [NAME] or [NAME] with [NAME], defensively, though? Yikes, to say the least.
You would know if you weren't such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant.
Congratulations on the low quality come back. Hopefully one day you can go to therapy to work on your resentment to bartenders. ‚ù§Ô∏è
So unsurprised by this, one of the most hated people in the music world. 
Glad we got that criminal off the streets! No-good [NAME]. Tsk tsk
i don't really feel comfortable posting there. i dont really have much reason to
It goes a long way to explaining American mental health issues. Have you ever bothered to read anything?
I would‚Äôve LOVED to be a part of something like this as a kid!!
Imagine the baby being retarded
That awkward moment when people who passionately hate [NAME] inadvertently portray him as a hero.
I enjoyed the effort from your dad so I must downvote but I want the subreddit to see this so I‚Äôll upvote
What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. 
woke take I appreciate you speaking the truth
"Except for ""fighting liberalism"". Happy cake day."
OK man I am relatively new so I know what worked for me and I based off of much of the advice I got, partially from this reddit lol
Lol ratheists suck fedoras!
im driving and i cant stop screaming i need to talk to someone in sorry
Too bad they lost.
Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.
Bruh, I‚Äôve been getting this tough love since I was 18. Hence the dusty balls. 
Just another example of why corporate business structures are inherently unethical and are a plague upon all work environments.
My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
From my point of view the freefolk are evil
LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
I friggin choked scrolling up to this
I almost pissed myself waiting so long in the tunnel. Not a fun feeling
sorry fam, but this is a repost on this sub as well.
This is so powerful.
People need to stop excusing bad behavior
This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
You're an odd fellow, [NAME], but you steam a good ham.
This is awesome! Saw you on r/entwives and pmd you btw! Congrats!
And they are right. [NAME] ([NAME]) even shot the ball and missed after [NAME] made shot
People tremble in fear of the name Rupple Poopels üòÇ
I also thought he was a she at first. Lol
You again? I already told you this isn't the right place for this.
That‚Äôs fair, I disagree with you, but I‚Äôm not here to change your mind. Was just curious. 
[NAME] doesn't even look that big here. But he's still handsome.
Lol you got nothing to worry bout from me bro. Thanks for keeping the game on
The double fist bump made me smile, her happiness was contagious
That‚Äôs cute wth
Yeah, when I saw she was in LA, I really hope that. Oh please, be true.
Lived this, it didn‚Äôt workout for me. Good luck on that one, I‚Äôd never do it again.
Holy fuck that stop, good shit [NAME]
Dude I don‚Äôt even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him
This was a beautiful moment for the FT coming together
Last time I tried to post, my post was deleted because I didn't have enough karma, wasn't even that long ago...
Hi Disappointed, I‚Äôm Dad!
I agree but I can‚Äôt force him.
They usually do hoss, hence the steak and beer hard to be sad with good food. 
[NAME] is huge fucking liar, but you seem to like him.
LOL. Super cute!
Tbh the giant cereal bowl bath is about as least cursed as it gets. ...I loved that episode
I use Lifesum too. I like the look of it more and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it not working.
Thank you! Happy New Year, hopefully it's a good one
"I am glad I found this subreddit ""gatekepping"" is a phenomenon vocab btw."
Unless you have an established career and are a high earner then sorry but you _are_ the shared housing type.
I'm so stupid, I can do this. On accident. so not very well.
The reason I play quickmatch. I wont feel the shame..
You‚Äôre in Iceland, a particularly craggy rock would be pretty interesting to you. 
>Any [NAME] who is married will skip her Well just for fun let's talk for a moment. Going to send you a PM.
It's the hard R that'll get you in trouble.
I‚Äôve been on team [NAME] since he won the axe toss competition after the draft, lol
Everyone upvote this - gotta spread the good news!!!
Mental health issues get such a bad rap as it is. I appreciate this comment a lot.
What the fuck? Really? That‚Äôs horrible. That‚Äôs probably illegal. If it isn‚Äôt, it should be.
Haha yeah. But still very nice of Ben I hope that the people who got it will use it 24/7
I mean New Orleans is really fun even with little to no drinking. I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
You can't be serious.
Take them out of his care and into the care of someone who can watch them until you are able to protect them yourself.
Why would the landlord pay it if electric isnt included. Sorry to OP, need to cut the heat down
After reading a lot of replies you should bee ashamed of yourself. This thread is a hive of bad puns and references.
So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !
Have a good good upvote!
Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.
That‚Äôs true, thank you
I can‚Äôt translate /s to Texan speak well and forgot so my apologies y‚Äôall :)
Should have just looked at them in disbelief and said what you don't make the police that have to work Christmas day a nice lunch. Lol
I just hope the Cavs don‚Äôt get the 1st pick fuck them
That‚Äôs cheating, gotta make a decision 
Agree! 60 new shoppers in Columbus I think is why. I removed Chillicothe and all those once but they came back. I am not going there!
I'm not commenting on their chemistry or whatever, just that the age gaps are similar and it's ok to point that out either way.
You‚Äôve done us a good service
Topic change #4. This is getting sad.
We should sign him to a 4.5AAV contract now that he has already proved himself as an elite starter in the NHL.
No credit?? This is the brilliant youtube channel You Suck At Cooking
The hair is super cool though
Glad you got her back! Fantastic way to start off the new year with good news!
In fact I plan to start using them in my videos since I plan to make this year feel like 2009.
I for one appreciate having the DD and Cat erotica in the same place.
Chernobyl incident has scared everyone to death about nuclear, I'm curious where we would be if that never occurred.
"Thank you. I will try to learn fron these. So far i only have read ""models"" and some advices on net."
I'm so sorry
Some people might be into that. There are some freaky people out there.
thank you very much, i do not care for it one bit
I like they think that it‚Äôs bad that we are thinking about the fucking POTUS. It‚Äôs almost like his actions effect us all
AYY! Anti-Semitism! Didn't expect that from AnCaps, but I'm not surprised.
I'm going to Chicago in a few months. I hear Sbarro's is great for authentic Chicago style pizza.
hey thank you! any time I can help someone, I'm more than happy to:)
Gorgeous cats, poor babies
I too think serfdom is good
The title made me laugh so much after reading this. Glad things are going great with your wife. Many more happy years to you three (:
Fool me once, shame on you...
That‚Äôs unfortunate
yeah violence shouldn't be your goto first option, but the people who pretend words are meaningless sounds are stupid idiots
Don‚Äôt feel bad for playing Minecraft, it‚Äôs still a great game and is starting to get kinda popular again.
R/T DIDN'T WANT IT!!!!
Great deal! It will be my loss if I decline.
Kindly shut your pie hole.
At this point, it‚Äôs certain that GA isn‚Äôt happening. 
as much as I could tolerate - sadly I gave you a view.
> Do you think Amazon reviews are don't mean anything? Yes because they are very easy to game.
I haven't had class in three years and yet I've literally had this nightmare dozens of times.
[NAME] with the beautiful backtap
I remember that one. It was so painful to watch
Zero percent. I sit when I piss cause I'm not an animal and I like to keep my bathroom clean.
Can't clear anyone of something that never happen or that they never did.
Alway protect yourself
Our draft choices are horrible anyway, it doesn't matter where we pick.
Oops. I assumed, wrongly, that it was the same person.
Sounds like a fun game. Our home game around here is .05/.10. Its fun but not very exciting.
She‚Äôs still living rent free inside your head if you‚Äôre looking her up Edit: thanks for the gold kind redditor tehehehehehehe ü§™ü§©ü§†
Oh for fuck‚Äôs sake.
Getting upset and triggered over a hat is absolutely failed moral character, and a sign of deep immaturity. 
[NAME] looked terrible that game. I was really hoping to be wrong but he came just as advertised by Hawks fans
So sorry for your loss! I lost my cat 6 years ago in 2021 due to terminal autism. üò≠üò≠
You'd better get to work then! See you in 10 years!
I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.
The attempt was successful. He's crying and not talking to them because they're actually dead.
Aww that makes me happy!
Man'. The point became invalid once the school yard name calling came out. And, 'this year'. It's only January.
Got the same pops! [NAME] a lot :) too bad I can barely play him, wish there was a Hwoarang pop
Haaaaa this was just on OZ the other night. Thanks.
You really think the Senate and then [NAME] will sign this lmao?
True Story! That's the sad Part of it...
Go pursue that education. Let [NAME] wallow in her own sadness.
So why wouldn‚Äôt the white Sox just offer an extra $20 million
Congratulations and by the way, you‚Äôre not fat, you are down to earth.
wrong place thats hilarious
Maybe, just this time, it's for the better.
Damn youtube and outrage drama is super lucrative for reddit
In my few years playing I never knew this ... I feel so lost now
Most people don't know the first thing about [NAME], so unsurprising.
They are always a fun time.
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
Yes I‚Äôm in a 2 bedroom now with a lot more space and yes they live in Virginia but they live in the Hampton roads area
Yup, it may not look like much but it‚Äôs still statistically significant. That‚Äôs really bad for something being decided by a coin toss.
I bet you this will lead to a new Revolution. [NAME] keeps on screwing himself.
[NAME] is a socialist I believe. He also seems like a lovely person.
LPT: As soon as you wake up make a repost, your virtual internet points will make you feel better.
This reply made me giggle. Sorry you got hit by a moron! Hope your car is repairable!
It's probably because your posts are extremely dumb and bigoted
I drive an old car but it is clean and well maintained.
[NAME] insists it went off the glass, i trust him!
Not really, every other post is summit doing something. Gets boring. 
Smh people aren‚Äôt seeing the real issue though. That‚Äôs the woman‚Äôs bathroom. ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Idiots gonna idiot.
Fucking Synths. -[NAME]
Is it wrong that I've been really disappointed that I haven't gotten to try out my new snowblower? :-/
Um, I was agreeing the context was indeed *very* different. Not sure what you're getting at. 
Funny a lot of rich kids think 100k a year is very feasible.
You shot well. UVA's defense wasn't that bad that game in all honesty. People underestimate the amount of luck involved in basketball, bottom line. 
Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
Damn it!
That‚Äôs something I hadn‚Äôt considered. I‚Äôll do just that. Thank you!
Lmao this is hilarious not cringe
Stuff like this is why I subscribed in the first place.
I love how he does the [NAME] shirt-pull because he is captain.
I hate that myself
You clearly don't understand alimony.
Lmao what an end to a quarter
I personally resent the RCA's centralization of conversion authority within the orthodox world. That's what I meant. Unrelated, I love your flair.
It isn't only a representation of the economy, but how poor most people's financial sense and budgeting skills are.
Her attempts to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù fall flat are incredibly cringeworthy.
I was skeptical about it being huge but damn..
Thanks man!
It makes customers uncomfortable because we're calling them on their BS and this is the only way to get them to own up to it.
Cheers to you on your cake day.
One time my 1 stopped right in 91st, I was able to get a good photo of the platform since they have some lights along it.
That was such awful bandaid application. Like what the fuck.
Why ‚Äúcover the name‚Äù if you can literally see it right after lol
Gotta offload this crap somehow.
[NAME] damn it
You guys look so amazing, even the pipe is making a jealous look... or maybe i'm just going blind from the cuteness.
Only when they have dirt underneath them, now that‚Äôs disgusting.
its ok, glad i watched the show, i enjoyed it.
Wow!! very funny
My exam is over and my winter break starts now üéâüéâüíÉ I've been waiting for this omg
Ha, ha your mad!
Considering that cheating is a mark of high-status, I'd be surprised if the wife dumped a cheating husband.
The only life that needs to be ended here is the life of the guy that raped your daughter. Abortion is just medicine
Awesome, glad you like it. I need to get one this week now.
I apologize for doubting you.
You're so talented OP. I like your sense of humor. But it hurts too cuz too real :(
Can we ban this person? Post history is sketch. Thanks in advance!
I had a panic attack when I saw that, thinking that I slept for 3 years and Hall was a Duck.
Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
Yeah, I'd definitely say you won this argument. Plenty of people love taking it up the bum and down the throat. Source. Am slut.
Thank you! We feel hard. We just don‚Äôt express it the same way feelers or maybe just most people recognize.
Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
ummmm Wulp I personally love a feminine man. I prefer it, ‚Äòmanly men‚Äô are gross and stupid 
What's worse is getting in a car that isn't yours
Love it yeet
Not my sub not my problem
You mean 4 of 5 dates for you already this month. Wow - do tell!
I‚Äôm sorry. Happy Birthday! I care ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love Ashtray
HOLY FUCK THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!
That is extremely uncomfortable to look at.
I will check him out thank you :)
It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
I love this movie! One of my favorite little touches is the music [NAME] character is listening to
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading
Me too. Sweet!
Modern buildings are horrible.. I‚Äôve felt like this before. Stars and birds still fill me with a sense of wonder most often.
Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren‚Äôt legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain.
Yes!! THANK YOU. I‚Äôm happy the point of this story was not lost among all.
> the heartbreak of a nice older truck being ruined Lol, the truck was new when this video was made.
Racism. They're talking about racism. The hate is the new KKK sheet.
Hitachi Magic Wand Thank me later.
Thank you. I‚Äôve been feeling a bit better since they make people happier.
Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It‚Äôs one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
Sadly I don't think even half the people who watched the game are gonna hear about that.
If I ever feel like getting shot... I am going to use this line. Thanks!
"That ""Hard work"" usually involved the junkrat pressing Q so I'm not about to shed tears"
That was your saddest shortest story yet
why the fuck is this getting downvoted
This is so tough for all of you! I'm so sorry!. Are you in Canada? I would push hard for a pediatric gastroenterologist.
He literally laid in pain on the ground after the fight longer than the loser did
This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
Omg congratz for you guys!!!!! That is amazing news :) good luck with twins.
Of course! Happy cake day üéÇüéâ
Oligarch-sponsored? [NAME], stop throwing buzz words at ideas you don't agree with. Read a book.
This is such a good game so far from literally all of BIG. THIS IS THE FUTURE BOYS!
‚ÄúEnjoy your dinner‚Äù
I agree. This is the real reason why I hate wearing pretty clothes and makeup. It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
I didn't see it the first time and appreciate the repost.
They really aren‚Äôt people. They were slavers. Civilized people should have only one answer to that sort of behaviour: violence and death.
"you said that he said ""women shouldn't be allowed in the workplace"" which is dishonest and false"
I wanna see a video proving it's fake though
Woo! New sci fi! Thanks!
I don‚Äôt think this fits the sub
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won‚Äôt witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
It's the wisdom of the fool.
If we draft another late round QB this year I‚Äôll probably have an aneurysm
This is the most majestic effortless mullet I have ever seen. The blending, the way his wavy locks lay. This is incredible. 
That‚Äôs pretty damn good
Not defending [NAME] at all but this is just super sad if it‚Äôs true...
I wish I could cry...
>more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it.
Lol I get it
both are bad tho anarchy ftw
The ‚Äúsad [NAME]‚Äù tops it off
I‚Äôm just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread ‚ÄúI was bored‚Äù
So prison isn't enough? You want him raped? That's disgusting.
Fuck that guy for game 2
I think this is very relevant, u/lilhan2
You are megalophobic, my friend. Welcome to the club.
Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
Lol same actually
Probably not making good pass decisions.
It will hurt, try to take your mind off things, and try to understand why it hurts
That thigh gap not cute at all
Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
It's probably more like when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I'm so sick of this paranoia.
I had someone do that to me on a delivery only order I was really upset it's another deceiving thing that we have to deal with on here
This is the most unathletic thing I've seen in a while.
Your driving makes me sick [NAME]
that's horrifying
My cat still loves me after I tripped over them in the dark on my way to the bathroom how are animals so amazing
No he's overrated
But this is a 1v1 game with a couple thousand people playing right. There had to be a better match.
Let people worship if they want to. It‚Äôs time for us to move forward and focus on bettering our own lives
I‚Äôd be interested in reading more about this if you have a good place for me to do so. Thanks.
I already know [NAME] sucks... He will be gone in 2 years but the shitty press that you support being like [NAME] will still be here. Congrats on supporting propaganda
She reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying.
Yeah, guess I'm old fashioned and don't downvote people clearly expressing a personal opinion. No matter.
[NAME] better be careful. He'll be next.
Very nice.
Wha? I‚Äôm so confused. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened because it wasn‚Äôt remotely warranted.
yiss they buffed [NAME], my favorite talent <3
Omg! Sounds like [NAME] was right about calling [NAME] a weirdo! That is so so odd!
Withdrawal, psychic-shattering, and other activist groups, the principle is very sad.
Magic are a good team. They battle every game
He is a douche, but I love that douche!
I like [NAME]‚Äô ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of losing, I‚Äôm not a loser‚Äù
Can attest. Vitamin deficiency here. Certain vitamins help alleviate bags under my well-rested eyes.
the last 2 are mocking the first you dumb asses
For me it‚Äôs the complete opposite. Complete dread in the morning and usually more hopeful in the evening.
Dude! Coyotes are no joke. Good job, [NAME]. 
we just don‚Äôt match amazon at all to avoid this sort of thing.
Fuck the rangers
I already called the county I got married in trying to find out about it but they had nothing on either of us about a divorce.. Im so anxious.
This could be an amazing metaphor for super smart AI‚Äôs. We‚Äôre the egg.
You deserve the same love. Those things are still true with you. You deserve love too.
This is fantastic and I'm happy for her!
30% of the country are insane.
Ok bud. I guess I havent been living my entire life with asthma and have 0 idea about this.
yikes, as someone who dislocates things often ([NAME]), this scares me!

It's prevalent in everything. WoW was incredible when it came out *because* everyone was garbage.
That guy is being intentionally obtuse. Down vote trolls are a waste of everyone's time.
The visual change is an underrated buff. The few times you could juke a legion as survivor were likely due to his blur that just got lessened.
That got rid of an unwanted boner real quick
Apologies, I take it all back as I‚Äôve just seen his latest effort
No it's propaganda we because r/politics only presents info, true or (usually) or otherwise info that is designed to hurts conservatives and help liberals. Propaganda

Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. 
The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
That‚Äôs kind of cool! You made a friend at the store. I usually make people want to leave.
Theres a BIG difference between being against ones (hateful) political position and between harassing someone for his ethnicity.
Its one thing to LOSE a debate, its another to be disqualified for wrong think. 
This makes me wanna die

Not everyone agrees that he was actually an amazing strategist or a great general, actually.
No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag.
I'm asking if you didn't realize orthodoxy considers not Orthodox movements to be wrong. I'm asking if you didn't realize what the implications are
what a dumb moment of faux outrage. can't wait to see what contrived outrage someone thinks up next.
He s ugly and short. It's pretty clear.
At least it‚Äôs not anything worse, and that you are still close to that person :)

Picturing you sneezing and banging your head made me laugh so hard! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET! Now, pipe down.

ehhhh I don't think so. iirc [NAME] was responsible for that Russian embargo and he's the reason why AKs are so expensive now.
It positively reeks of an abusive household
Yet I still feel lonely doing it...
Enjoy friend.
In case anyone is questioning...the title is sarcastic.
[NAME] what an asshole.
If I haven‚Äôt told you lately...I love you and you are my hero. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
[NAME] can‚Äôt you see, you‚Äôre being way too loud for me
I know, that's why I said one of the reasons. The main reason is his uselessness when your team is bad
Not all atheists do this, but some do and it's a genuinely strange phenomenon.
Is that Riverside, CA? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from! Sadly I was barely a teen in 1993-first time I saw them was Dec. 1996
Oh so you're being a troll, good to know.. I actually thought for a second that disgusting, freak couples like y'all actually existed
"Yea, so you need to leave him. Clearly not great in the ""protect your loved ones"" situation. "
It‚Äôs all about the tech my friend. The person who knows how to control the modem has the power.
He was trying to move the gun away so that it wouldn't hurt anyone!!!!.
This is really cute
These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
Your just killing time now.
In other words, being a woman but not identifying with your oppression. How special
The new movie doesnt even look very good honestly
That's a lovely thought, really awesome of you. Don't know personally but you could try contacting the Seoul International Women's Association (SIWA).
Oh man you sure showed me, good job champ
Loved that shithole base! (not being sarcastic)
That's not what he meant. He means the use of a lot of different hashtags.
Definitely not Fox News though! That‚Äôs the real stuff, zero lies or bias there!
I'm infinitely more interested in why the Physique one has an extra like
And it is always because of a dropped combo that should have killed
Good luck! Hockey season still has a few months to go. Might wanna invest in a punching bag. Two birds with one stone

Lol I love this flair
*I curse you to an eternity of walking barefoot on a world of Lego!*
Thanks I was wondering what the sparks from his head were about.
The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
Other than some wacky pick up orders, the dine-in customers are very sweet at my place. It‚Äôs a good thing :)
Can confirm, girl asked my out on a second date and my comfort levels and confidence sky rocketed
Feminists body-shaming and objectifying men

How embarrassing.
What the fuck is this doing in a cryptocurrency sub
Some bioshock shit right here.
There kinda funny
Did you even venture to scroll through the nearly 2h long video linked in this thread? Not hard to find....seems like you are just avoiding it.
They're all bad enough to be lumped in to the same category? You either have very high standards, or none at all.
Nothing good can come from knowing. Just let it go and focus on the relationship in front of you
I‚Äôm thinking so, since the sides are spiky and somewhat serrated.
LHW is such a barren shithole that I‚Äôd be more excited for this than anyone at 205 getting a shot
Huge shout out to [NAME], wherever he might be, for always fighting the good fight!!!!
Fuck your shitty ass title
I am still confused a bit lol
Don‚Äôt explain how you‚Äôre feeling to her either. Women like men who‚Äôs feelings are unclear.

I do not believe she has any secret information, but I still suspect she's in danger and her plan has backfired substantially.
It would do us ALL a great deal of good.
Agree with everything here. Going to med school abroad will always put you at a disadvantage if you want to practice in the states
Self serving cowards.
"""[NAME] remains being [NAME]"" is absolutely perfect."
Focus on yourself by focusing on your prayers and reminding [NAME]
I think sweaty is hilarious in the context of r/forwardsfromgrandma which is where I see it 90% of the time
The most hatful crowd is not the lefties. Lefties may be annoying but hate as such is a tool used by the right much more skillfully and forcefully.
You‚Äôre right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them
That's exactly what I would expect [NAME] parents to look like lol
"Yes, we'll see! On a separate note, when I read your user name at first glance I thought it was ""ItGetsThroughBoner""."
Dude it‚Äôs my dream to go to Australia on vacation
My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
I joined a club and that's how I made friends. Try joining a club.
As an [NAME], half of [NAME] are unfortunately right

Did that with an oven pizza at 3am in my underwear. Got burns all over my stomach
I know the planes are bad, but come on man.
Wanting to have immigration controls is in no way, shape, or form racist. 
Religion is absolutely a problem. But to say the left doesn't have its own analogues is ridiculous.
I don‚Äôt want my tax dollars going to some psycho who thinks he‚Äôs a girl trapped in a mans body
This sounds very familiar...
Don't you fucken do it
General population are scared of press

Lol I need details!?
No they shouldn't. Mental illness is a serious thing and we shouldn't encourage crazy people but instead help them
He was credited in commentaries as the inspiration for Cletus. I always loved the way he just wants that dog.
That should usually be the giveaway‚Äîthough they now wear these ridiculous waist-high tights to hide the fact they don‚Äôt have workout bodies either.
This describes his tweets so perfectly lol >At no point during your incoherent rambling did you even come close to what could be considered a rational thought

I'm glad :)
I'll die on this hill with you. Amen.
Obviously not real but damn i wish it was.
You got this! Go easy on yourself man..
Ripped but not bulky is anything but unremarkable. So, attractive, talented, and rich. I can't imagine what women see in guys like that.
You can slice it anyway. If it has sugar or heavy sugar than tax it or go for specific categories like soda and candy etc.
What's he whining about, I am only 52 and stuck on SSI now and only getting 1400.00
The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes.
Had a whole grilled lamb at an Indian restaurant once for a corporate event. It was amazing
That looks like total garbage.
Lmfao. Omg I‚Äôm dead. Please do more of these somehow
I hate people using the [NAME] to look ‚Äúdeep‚Äù on instagram posts like that. It gets on my nerves so much
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.

All those statistics are nonsense. There has never been ‚Äútrue‚Äù capitalism.
Submit yourself to science to investigate this intriguing event.
Looks delicious.
When religion and flags get entwined, bad things happen.
Weed has never killed anyone. Until now.

Ahaha, a Jersey driver calling other drivers awful... that's adorable.
felt like that shot by palms was our first in a while
Sure, but I don‚Äôt think those costs outweigh [NAME] getting caught in crossfire on Queen Street.
Been there, done that. Not the best idea unfortunately. Especially if it doesn't work. Gets awkward 
Yeah I was impressed with it too! I've to pay to see results of responses past the 100th one but other than that it's top notch
That's really sad and shocking to hear this Really embarrassed to be a human being on this earth...
I KILL YOU SCUM
Thanks for a different perspective, this made me feel better.
We need these people on our side; arguing with them may be both thankless and fruitless, but the argument must be put to them. 
So you are projecting to defend your hate. Nice psyche you have there enlightened one
cool cool...
I just HAD to tell at her parents and pass on my misinformation! üôÑ
same but with panic at the disco
This might actually be one of the few cases where parallel poly will make sense, then ^^
I disagree. It's a couple of loud voices and some pretty blatant brigading from at least one of them.
For sure...sometimes I feel like I will just evaporate into nothingness as the stranger in the mirror looks on.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** CrimsonEagl3! ^(hug)
Thank you! [NAME] is a character that means a lot to me, and it makes me happy that you like my portrayal of her.
Great, another article from a guy who thought making [NAME] the head coach was the answer.
Man I really need to get back into this show
Thank [NAME] I don't have any friends

Well if you're moving to Dallas, it's basically the same thing as Oklahoma and California combined. You're totally safe there!
He starts mildly enough with a pucker... then when she *backs away* he opens his mouth and goes further. Seriously - what kind of idiot is that guy?
If you were to ask me how my 2016 went, I could go on and on but politics wouldn‚Äôt even come up once
Truly wretched.
Much better thanks hun !
I would be creeped out.
I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am.
I‚Äôm sorry. But, keep your respectability politics to yourself
EMAO fats (Eat my ass off)
She‚Äôs probably very traditional. Why haven‚Äôt you tried to kiss her yet?
Cant you tell how sad she is from her face?
When is that? There will always be supporters who don't support the players.
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn‚Äôt have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.
Eesh, really sorry for your loss.
Finally a whole season and 3 jornadas too late.
You realize everyone sees you REEEEEEing all over the place right? You can act nonchalant all you want but obviously youre one salty sea dog

Yes! I was lost without subtitles on Sons of Anarchy.
If it was low-fat mayonnaise, their response may have been justified. That stuff is horrendous.
Either way, it's at the very least not an ethical way to conduct business.
Uhhhh... didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall just eat the light lunch that you said you wanted on your preference sheets? Shut up.
The capitalist countries have welfare for those that can cope. The other countries dont.
Classic Leslie!
The 100,000 who died in the Tokyo bombing during WWII weren't killed by [NAME], it was just the passive spreading of fire. Fuck off, genocide apologist. 
Love this twitter account.
‚ÄúRegain the fan base‚Äù. How immature do you have to be to believe that everyone agrees with you.
Bat Out of Hell is awesome start to finish, I'd love to see a musical based on it.
Seriously, check his food. It is upsetting his stomach.
Didn‚Äôt realize two different intros were so many. I‚Äôll warm this community up to hip hop eventually ;) Appreciate the shoutout!
Yep, that's my daily commute.
The guy just loves drama
Looks like donkey foals are going for between $50-$100. That‚Äôs quite the herd.
Or they just don't understand why cats do that with kittens.
He looks like he has entered the ultimative stance of mind
Omg!! Its rainbow!!
No they aren't.
If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don‚Äôt share in their happiness for the bitter cold.
Love the top logo although I‚Äôd gladly take the bottom one, the goat head, or a poop emoji any day over the buffaslug.
But then you regret it because you realize you secretly liked the attention. Just bottom things.
> us common peasant imbecile [NAME]. At least you admit it.
I always admire a pinch of salt in anything. I can't upvote you enough sir.
I don't control the Lib Dems, shockingly.

Lol this was cosmetic. Thankfully both of mine are alive and well.
So happy for you, enjoy 
Of course [NAME] doesn't like competition for his religious fantasies. That surprises no one.
Science damn you!
I don't believe that there's any justification for an authoritarian government.
[NAME] was not aware that I had managed to diss the entire New Labour legacy in so few words but you read what you want to... hun?
Congrats keep going
There is nothing this Government could cut that wouldn't upset someone. Sorry, but weez broke.
The poor car.
Thanks. 22-23 is about when Chabad bochurim tend to do semichah. And it's officially always done before marriage.

Hey- that's where I play tennis! No slapshots, pls.
There's a sweet spot. Pathfinder Kingmaker has important lines voiced, and others are just text. It works great.
I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
I wanna hug my mom dead named me waking me up for school
It makes me feel good. Wholesome is a very subjective thing.
Love the new intro song.
The real villains are those aware of the cruelty of life, but then reproduce anyway.
Very sad. People like this are ruining Aus.

Even if I did, no one would believe me....,
Happy little lies.
i hate furries
Disgusting performance. [NAME] appears clueless.
Please stop using that term.
That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
Disgusting, but fascinating.
For the love of [NAME] do not ever link that again
They're not the brightest bunch.
Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do

It's absolutely 100% abuse, as others have said you need to get the hell away from him.
Yes applaud the atheist and slam your brothers in the apostolic faith, way to go. 
[NAME] ain't all that. Sorry.
Sorry, my phrasing was terrible. Not across the board, but eggs are definitely an example where OP was right.
I seriously don‚Äôt get how these refs allow everything to go in the first half, but the slightest touch is a foul in the second. 
thank you!
I think you're mistaken, muscle memory is rather strong it would simply be a reflex
why wont i just fucking die
I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression.
Your comments are nothing but rhetorical ways of telling me I'm wrong. Zero substance.
Weird headline. 2 children per mother would be expected to shrink the population.
Been with ethnic girls, blondes, brunettes, and a fake red head. No correlation. 
Didn't even know it was my cake day lol. Only lasted 5 to 10 minites, wasn't too bad 
The amount of empty seats at the Orange Bowl was pretty bad
My favorite gusgasm

No no no, the ball was tipped. He‚Äôs a great kicker
You describe yourself as your knowledge of Asian languages stopping at knowing they exist? How did you know it was Mandarin then? That's impressive.
That's just damn creepy.
Worst episode of the entire show

He's a hypocrite like everyone else in his family and party.
Honestly, same. I was miserable at my admin asst job.

He goes after my Wisconsin teams all the time... so I live that one haha. Pisses me off but still love em
Yup, it's from the latest episode. Thanks! :[NAME]!
If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet.
To me, the best smell a person can have is just a clean smell. 
Shame on you
I kind of think if you spell dissuade diswayd you lose any benefit of the doubt.
Interesting. Can you give some examples?
Uh, sorry. We're under trumpcare now.
I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. 
Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?
Problem is that picture is there before you ever set foot in the cabin; [NAME] put it there. Just makes it creepy.
Aww! congratulations!
I was assaulted by my father once too. Please don‚Äôt hate yourself, it was not your fault. It was his doing. 
What a totally innocent and integral part of our society! So glad our tax money can keep him company over his year long holiday!
This comment completly proves the opinion of the OP right lmao. I‚Äôm so sorry America doesn‚Äôt meet your standards oh mighty reddit commentor
Sounds like my SIL with me/hubby. But she's a bitch and we never liked her anyways, so neither of us really care lol. 
FaceTime with wifey!! Happy anniversary!
This is where the fun begins.
[NAME] did nothing wrong
I was suffering a delirium flu during the phantom facemask game so it‚Äôs all sorts of suffering for me.
Go forth and get rated, my child. 
Thank you. And I love your flair. My toddler is the same haha
Yep, usually if it was the other way around she would love both of her cultures.
First of all, sorry for your loss. Keep in mind that funerals are for the people still alive not the person who has just died.
Yeah. I do wish you the best. It's not gonna be easy but I do. You're welcome!
For sure. Thank you.
It was so great to have a nice friendly NPC like that. Just one student that didn't hate our guts.
Eh, I'm not a fan of the grayscale. Looks too Kingsish. 
Get your feet off the table...
Boston sports doesn‚Äôt deserve anymore titles, fuck the pats
I don‚Äôt CARE!
HOW DARE YOU!!
No, but it diverts resources from the art team, and prevents them from making content which would have been better recieved by the already low playerbase!
Now if only America would do this
"Yeah, I'm happy to help an actual friend in need, but not some distant acquaintance ""friend""."
He‚Äôs had big games for us before, it‚Äôs just his lack of consistency and effort 
A 2-day old account, and this is how you decided to use your time? Trolling the teacher subreddit? Ok dude...
When it‚Äôs read this way it‚Äôs way more badass. The way people normally quote it just sounds stupid.
This is weirdly funny to me
Have you visited any of the car subs? They may be able to help you diagnose the issue. Good luck though, I hope ya pull through. 
You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
I‚Äôd probably need up spending all of my money on food and ammo, I like having a limit
Did you have to ask? Just pay the ticket and be done with it.
Will be when we organise a run on the banks and hopefully take the only thing Westminster cares about away from them.
This guy fucking gets it.
That‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm probably going to donate to them I can‚Äôt imagine not missing out on a season because someone stole.
"Also the sneezing. The dog is sneezing which is canine for ""this is a great game"""
Omg she's gorgeous!
Good retort! Thank you for your contribution to the discussion.
Hey /r/Hockey Bro! Sorry about the Sens. At least this made you smile in the dark times.
Very true, interesting point of view. 
We only seem to hate them when they espouse murderous political philosophies responsible for more than 100 million deaths. Weird, huh?
Absolutely adore this
Hey Singapore, you‚Äôre in luck!
"Reply with ""Oh, my bad"". Don't make a big fuss out of it. People make mistakes."
It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will.
Girl then DM me if you visit! It‚Äôs a great place to live. I moved from NY.
Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him.
[NAME], [NAME] is the most underrated [NAME]. I love that guy. 
no not really i knew he was joking i was just clarifying what the bloke said
He could run for President of the US and WIN!
Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it 
Motor Kombat was awesome. Goofy as hell, but awesome.
This is pretty funny. I‚Äôve known dozens of people who fall into all of those stereotypes.
honestly, individually he's been awful so far.
Should be best right now. Speculating on what might happen in the future is pretty pointless.
I wish that show would come back
of moms give birth BY 30. About 11-13% of women are childless. Please lol some more.
Your mindset is the right mindset, sadly, it's easier said than done.
So THIS is what it's like to have a seizure when listening to self control...
Might not have fallen if little miss [NAME] didn‚Äôt have to pull her skirt back.
Any time. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Just don‚Äôt drink your emotions like I did.
[NAME] is hot garbage on that court. He has been the biggest disappointment of any player this season.
My point is we have been shit for the most of the season, today we are just shit in a new formation
Dude is gonna end up playing in his boxers one day lol
Funny, the right only seems to say this about women and people of color ü§îü§îü§î
where‚Äôs that tashy bastard
Laziest team I've ever seen.
not quite as cheap but if you already own a decent bike this kit is wel priced to convert
Yeah, a lot of people conveniently forget how devastating spacial apartheid was, and how permanent it's effects were designed to be.
Beautiful!!
Waiting to see if a card expansion will make the game fun.
Your life must be miserable. That's sad somehow
I guess I've never seen that written out. Thanks for the correction.
Good answer. Thanks for taking the time.
Nah. I just need to stop answering before I go to bed. Got the post and the replies mixed up in a sleepy haze.
If you take that line, any excess money you have is immoral. Tough line to tow.
Pepsi tastes better in the UK than Coke but US/Canada coke is pure diabetes and Pepsi is disgusting.
I can say when I was 16 I never did anything even remotely as hateful as what these kids did. It's really easy.
I love u too <3
That was so sad. And she kept calling for mommy the whole time. Then they ditched her with grandma.
food pranks really irk me üòî
Yes - 21 of the cases were kids
i hate this
Omg this made me hurt! You better of gotten a damn good back rub after that.
love this! makes me want to go hiking at superstition this weekend.
I've had good luck reselling on StubHub. They take a cut but it is secure and easy to do.
Doubt is an integral part of faith. Dont worry, it will help you in the long run
Those lines were an embarrassment today. I couldn‚Äôt not believe it.
I used to work nights at a 24-hour Walmart, ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù is a damn tame word for it.
I absolutely love how you can't read what's in yellow somehow it perfects this cringe
Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.
You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is.
Does it contain like 5 members like the real one? lol.
I watch it because I enjoy it
i hope you get fired or rejected from your job for some stupid arbitrary reasons, maybe then you'll wise the fuck up
"I put ""haha"" after everything I say because I'm insecure "
On VPR yes she is awful. On WWHL she seems very nice, and likeable. Not sure what's going on there. 
"I knew the punchline as soon as I read ""Tide Pods"" and I hated both myself and you for it. Take your upvote."
Thanks for the link, my email indeed was breached it says. I‚Äôm just not sure what this exactly means.
I constantly feel like I'm my husband's best friend and it's just a matter of time until we break up :(
If you‚Äôre being contentious, then I have no interest in discussing this. There‚Äôs plenty of other threads you can search.
Got boomhauer(?)(boom-how-er) pretty right tho his character was apparantly a [NAME].
2018 was the worst year for Sydney Trains, I‚Äôve lost count of the number of cancelled services due to power outages and train drivers calling in sick
Oooo thanks! Hopefully I‚Äôll be home from work by then!
I think so. It‚Äôs one of my favorite [NAME] characters and a fun trilogy. At that price point I think it‚Äôs really worth it
I agree. I‚Äôd love to keep [NAME] around but recognize it might not be possible.
If this is real it‚Äôs just the best thing I‚Äôve ever come across. I‚Äôm still crying laughing after 10 minutes!
Oh man this is horrible and the best summary of this subreddit in one single comment. I love it. Thank you so much.
I woke up drunk and mouthy
He's trying!
Fingers crossed. Its the chosen people and not the choice people for a reason.
I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term.
Okay I can see why that is one glorious beard
Thanks. I appreciate that. At least I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
Sorry, no. We‚Äôre just going to export [NAME] to you guys. 
Excuse you, rice is the best food. Rice is love, rice is life.
You know what you‚Äôre right, not with risking my CC info. Good thing I was too lazy to do it right away. 
That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
It's shameful how this sub sold out to Big Broccoli (TM).
their just mad because i love olicity and i think it's the best ship in the whole arrowverse. oh and because i think laurel is trash.
I fell asleep with the feeds on last night and woke up pretty frightened at the noises coming from my computer. Thank you for casting Tom BB hahahaha
I gave up trying to be 'normal' years ago. But I get your point though.
[NAME] shot that shot with confidence i like that
Ahh going to bother me I remember it. Let me do some research!!
Sorry if I was insulting, I just took your post as some commie type smugly trolling how stupid [NAME] is 
Well, it did just win a golden globe, so maybe a few more people will see it because of that
Oh my, my Japanese course is paying off! Yes that's what I was trying to say üòÑ
Well...to be fair then. :)
Wendy‚Äôs sauce I hope lol
I‚Äôm finishing that right now. Very fascinating.
I really liked his answer to the QB success question. The Tebow part was also unintentionally hilarious.
[NAME] chatting with a kid while waiting to come out for the stars of the game. What a great guy.
Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
If this is the kind of game you enjoy, you should REALLY check out Blades in the Dark!
I was 10 years old when this happened and seeing her heartbroken dad on tv and hearing her story still haunts me.
SS: Collapse of the west, and re-birth, all in a beautiful video.
should've rolled into battle with a sword brad. that would have fuckin' rocked
Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. 
Many thanks!
I forgot context and thought you meant the band was republican, please don‚Äôt worry me like this again 
i actually dont mind either of those
Oh they can make numbers up too , good idea. Astroturfing starwars, this is the worst timeline.
^ This. You know the guy's a liability when multiple teams openly admit to taking advantage of his defensive inconsistency at the left.
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?!
there is no compromise with people who hold the American people hostage for something the American people don't want. don't negotiate with terrorists.
No, it isn't K.
I'm here through the week. So far I've met [NAME], French and Haitian people and it's been amazing!
I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
Did feel that one but I find it hard to tell sometimes
Disinfected or sanitized maybe. No way an entire exam table is sterilized.
I‚Äôm sorry
I mean, if I make it look like an accident, just think of all the ribs I can buy with the insurance money... 
I know how you feel :( I hope you start getting more good days soon. <3
"Sorry but why does it matter that you're ""from /r/All""? "
"Lol OK. I guess we'll skip over the ""generally accepted"" part of the definition cuz why not, eh?"
Our education system has been a complete and utter failure...
I suppose when discussing socialism one ought to avoid the use of the word prosperity, it does become a touch embarrassing. 
Excuse my wording. I should‚Äôve said [NAME] all around game & unselfishness combined with [NAME] aggressiveness & scoring
I'd give them a first, but they have to retain salary. You know they'll just destroy that first round pick too.
I'm so nervous!
"""We should be happy that we moved from 4th to 5th"""
thanks for the recap
Piracy is going to have a massive increase in the coming years.
Agreed! Hopefully! :-)
I hope that stays on all their programs from now on. Would really add a new element to Corrie.
Terfs smell like bigots in general. Sort of a salty smell
Ah [NAME] I love this post!
Should you choose to have kids, you're going to make a good parent one day.
You can't just assert that something came from nothing, you need to provide evidence for said claim.
Honestly took me by surprised. Good job!
I hope [NAME] at least showers before his funeral.
Les Collines (Never Leave You) is still a bop. I loved that song and is still awesome in 2019.
happy cake day
Don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs more afraid of you than you are of him. Just act tough, it‚Äôll work...maybe...
Good luck in the future man. We're not getting anywhere here. Have a great weekend!
Don't stay too long or you might go Nakamoto : P
Thank you! I still cant believe someone could be so selfish and awful and deliberately try to ruin Christmas for kids. So awful.
And the players who are older than me are retiring and it looks like I might never play professional baseball.
I‚Äôm crying omfg
Happy New Year
Last night [NAME].
I‚Äôm scared for y‚Äôall saying Undone.
The lack of teabags is the only emergency here. You thwarted an attack on your child.
We also turned the ball over about a million and 3 times. I'm over it honestly
And sock puppets. Wow. Nothing out of you is in good faith.
That is not the typical sexual dynamic in western cultures. That's a crazy asshole.
I had so many avatars named after Star Wars characters on Millsbury. I miss it üò≠üò≠üò≠
Glad your nights going well guys
Baby you was right
Someone tell me why they are out passing us they taking the game to us when we should be controlling the tempo of the ball to keep the lead.
Solid as a rock!
You deserve this
Happy Cakeday!
I actually kinda like this bug because I like to get trippy
yeah i misread billions as millions. my bad
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is it just me, or do these children look really uncomfortable around the Duggars? The smiles look forced...
You tell me, was this a short trip or not? I was wrong, it was 4.3 
Yes, some doctors look down on military docs. However, I've never seen military nurses looked down upon. If anything, it gives them a leg up.
That was sexy
Philanthropy really scares some people, doesn't it? People did this to [NAME] too. 
His estate still have property in places like ireland. To this he has grounds rent paid to him
[NAME] is a comedian. Every monologue he does is based in humor -- extremely intelligent humor. He is also extremely observant.
You seem like a well adjusted individual
Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads. That is usually really important in assault.
I apologise, I'm a bit hot headed at times, especially on this account.
Well, I don't agree, but I do appreciate having a real discussion rather than just name calling lol. Agree to disagree
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
I didn't know that they had that on there lol. Are those the kind of shows that you're into?
thanks. I really hope it does get better
I hate when I get extremely bored doing something that was once all consuming.
What an idiot.
I‚Äôm in my second year. Still closeted. Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality. Still socially awkward.
 I don‚Äôt give a F F the haters F all the haters Much love, no hate Machines within, machines within
I dont think they were angry att them self. Its allways the kids fault./s
What a hilarious joke... Comedy has basically become bashing.
Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that
Hahaha the first fall is the best ha
I can't help it. It's just so perfect.
Oh ok. I'll go check them out :)
Mate none of these are accurate. I only read these articles as an excuse to get mad at something
It really is. I didn't know a thing about the feud and it caught me off guard how brutal it was. Enjoyed it a lot though.
Mate honestly what you had was a serious relationship with her, for all 13 years. I hope you heal up well.
Super, thanks
Thanks for the breakdown [NAME].
I love this reply.
I‚Äôm feeling the same about the nets and hornets. I‚Äôm only worried the hornets can‚Äôt cover
the worse part is you might be crazy yourself and have no idea!
it's quite a large red flag. It depends on the context, but if they are in her dating league, I would be suspicious. 
What was the name of the neurology podcast? That sounds very interesting!
Yet *I* get banned for saying you should downvote posts you don‚Äôt like. Fml
I love how the tires are Raiders logo
I would of taken a shit in the woods real quick
Different region of same hellscape. Congrats, good luck!
I laugh every god damn time.
Oof that hurt
Correct but Reddit won't admit that as the reason.
They didn't actually run any tests to confirm it was even bone, let alone human.
One of my 56 favourites
Yeah it's a weird thing people do
It's wonderful and gives me happy happy feels
If you think it's a real emergency don't waste too much time and try to call the police
Did it taste good; I bet it tasted good.
Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :‚Äô)
> It almost feels like this is totally a shameless, contentless promo post for your YouTube channel and this book.
Had to comment just to say that I don't even know what to say to this. It's so mindblowingly stupid.
This sounds encouraging. I hope they get lots of support from the public.
Using high capital (money/picks) for 3 edge rushers would both be incredibly stupid *and* unjustifiable
Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
I just don't like OP for not explaining it before using the abbreviation. So even though the TIFU was great I downvoted it.
[NAME] damnit, have your upvote 
Apparently not successfully.
Thank you once again! I'm officially out of question now lol Happy New Year!
Yeah, apparently I missed the joke back there a bit Hahaha. 
The problem is not getting new players but keeping the current ones.
Don‚Äôt rush it .... it will eventually all fall into place, Enjoy today 
Neither are those 6 other pairs that I am wearing!!!
"ITT: People saying ""I'm doing to get downvoted for this"" and then not getting downvoted."
Thats harassment brotha. Do you double dare me
They're the same people who will tell you 600 a day is unhealthy
Grow up.
I call bullshit on this anon said they were ‚Äúwalking‚Äù ... you know they were in the scooter cart.
The only rank that can't be deranked is diamond. However, all rewards are based on peak elo. So don't be afraid to keep playing.
More along the lines of ‚ÄúI could stick that vein with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back‚Äù lol
I was browsing the site and just figured r/Browns would do the trick...NOPE!
Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger.
Are you high? People go for walks while wearing clothing all the time. It's when you go without the clothes that you run into problems.
oh god this is the worst
Why is this being downvoted lol?
at least you found it
This sub is a fucking joke now
Beautiful stranger i don‚Äôt have to talk to them after
first alien is hotter tbh
Lol nice. I can't say the same yet. What do you do for a living if I may ask?
Yet... here you are, a nodoby whining about others accomplishments on the internet. 13 year old you was probably smarter than you are now.
Thank you so much I'm going to start it right after the Golden Globes!
I think [NAME] could've been a long term quality backup. We really should have hung onto him and ejected [NAME] like a bad habit.
It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
Miami is supposed to have beautiful people, but these camera shots of the crowd sure as hell aren't showing them.
beautiful story arc. glad you decided to end it in my semi hometown of excelsior - really neat lil town.
You're very welcome. You do, and I hope (for your sake and especially for your daughters') that things work out for you all.
Loooooool what?
Yeah, I guess you‚Äôre right! I‚Äôll definitely try talking to him. Thank you
Nice catch.
I get what you mean but still that's like mixing ammonia and bleach, it's not gonna go out well.
I sure hope so! Smug bastards!
aw, thanks! I appreciate that! 
hahaha, this is great. We need more anarchist jokes.
Damn democrats, if they think they're caring for the children, why don't they just change the weather then, never thought about that one. 
Wish I could vote this up 1,000!
If you make them get out in this. You deserved the fucking ticket.
Dont forget [NAME]. He was a reliever converted to starter. Hes got some ridiculous pitches just needs to work on consistancy
Where did I say that happened? Lmao most of my friends are single for the record. Quit jumping to conclusions.
So so good
I'm with you!!!!!!
Your girlfriend looks so Irish! You guys are cute as fuck.
Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about
The UK having disdain for Ireland or Irish people isn‚Äôt exactly new.
Im glad you took that step. Sometimes its really hard making that decision, but im glad you didnt force yourself to be miserable
"I thought the army would be like the top image. ""Then why the fuck did you sign up as a [NAME] OP"""
Feels like im wearing nothing at all!
Seeing [NAME] score on them was unbelievable. How embarrassing!
Love that car
Wish me luck fellas need Houston +8.5 to win $1700ish currently 113-114 Come on gambling gods
I switched the the Smok Novo and I like it. Close enough to the juul.
You are right
Hey now!
No, it's because of the misogyny that's often present in the community. 
Thank you, needed to hear this today! 
I thought Detroit or Oakland . . . and both have fantastic areas despite what pop culture might lead you to believe.
My favourite commentator on this game
Yeah, however you spell it - I don‚Äôt play with them 
Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore
I think its absolutely wonderful : )
That‚Äôs a rad gift.... I cried when he came back from cancer. He was my hero
Good always love him
As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude.
"All that condescension to spell ""capitulate"" wrong. Shame."
Keep rebuilding. That‚Äôs all we can do
Damn, you're right. I could've sworn I saw a 99% up there.
It's funny to consider DMC2 had characterization
It looks like Livonia flipped light blue as well? That‚Äôs pretty impressive.
Try posting to r/mentalhealth I'm sorry this is happening to you and I hope you get better.
So. Damn. Greasy.
[NAME]. is getting REALLY good!
Thank you for your input! I‚Äôll look into it
Good luck! Also, your story cracked me up. I've been going through some interviews myself lately but fortunately they were over the phone üòÖ
I am here to tell you that it really will work out okay! I have certainly felt like you before. It sucks to feel lonely.
They probably got de-funded. I need to support them.
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. üò≠ sad day.
Always wanted to try [NAME], I'll add her to my list.
Wow he wants people to donate so he can make a large profit off his atm? Lmao Good gig if you can get it I guess...
Is it bad that im really bummed he didnt get hit?
Honestly tho. Please stop posting this. We've been seeing this shit since at least 2003 and I was born in 02 ffs
No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
Yeah, neither of them are communists. [NAME] is a left-leaning [NAME] and [NAME] is a [NAME]
For a sec I thought I was on NoSleep. I'm glad no one got hurt.
Poor fish :(
Barista Parlor and Crema have been my favorite so far.
Thank you!
Real fact, Elephants see us as cute in the same way we see dogs and cats as cute.
Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born.
His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
That's pretty much what you signed up for when you had kids.
The reason I was commenting was because the other day i was reading threads about how it's annoying that the ocs doesnt do the bulk discounts
That‚Äôs the nicest thing ever said to me. Thank you!
get your ass to mars!
That's true, you'd imagine it'd have come up beforehand. 
Damn this kid and her fancy clothes makes me feel like a bad parent.
Their behavior? Going to campuses to talk about fiscal responsibility and [RELIGION] values is something that is bad? You‚Äôre a bigot, just admit it. 
Loved his wife.
Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
Don't listen to them, we need to call this kind of stuff out.
I love the enthusiasm inherent in the scream. I never saw anything wrong with it. Not to mention the most innocent, innocuous dancing video ever.
No, lots of people in that area do that. Hire someone to do your taxes because it'll be a nightmare and so will your commute
Sure, there are edge cases where this is less clear, but in the vast majority of conflict, this is true.
What a wonderful world
No way we would turn down [NAME] for [NAME]. BS
Yeaaahhh... *blushes*
That...that was way more disturbing than the top level sub. What the fuck?
Yeah, The Donald seems to spread its purging mentality to most right leaning subreddits. Reminds me, I should get banned from r/theDonald again for quoting [NAME]
Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE
But now we're stressed out.
Very astute observation.
Yes its absolutely freeing! And so pure :) Aaah my heart
YES! Here's to us HAPAs!
I know! I'd buy this for my unit my coworkers would love it üòÇ
I mean if my wife looks like that when I get married then I‚Äôll be quite happy.
The secret and walk away endings are not cannon.
Yes it does
That just shows how similar people can be in this kind of situation, demanding, rude, and can sometimes damage stuff without care
That makes sense, thanks
Your husband is a lucky man.
Well I for one think small d**** are adorable
That kid has the face of a douchebag
Thing is...it's the media the masses take in that is driving this anxiety [NAME] or AP reader isn't falling for this
I hate people.
I'd rather not be in the 90's kid category anyways.
an obvious joke
How many shitposts does it take to make me unsub
"Haha, my mind started quoting ""the standard of truth has been erected..."""
People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
Sorry. This happens to too many good people.
Hmm. I don't disagree. It's unfortunate.
yeah but like I‚Äôm highkey anxious about getting shocked and screw Apple for getting rid of the rainbow logo, it was so cool
You should really go see Aquaman though. In IMAX if you can - it's breathtakingly beautiful.
I am already so stoked for her eventual WATN episode, because she's going to keep kicking ass.
Thank you [NAME].
Sure you can. A class of preschoolers can be replaced by their parents in the space of four years.
He can‚Äôt be like that in that business but it already sounds too late. No wonder his staff quit on him.
Yeah I‚Äôll take my downvotes. Just a gut feeling
this off season is dark and full of terrors
remember when he scored 4 tries in a game? that was cool
She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
Firstly, congrats on not being pregnant!! Now there is nothing tying you to him and you're free to find greener pastures. :)
One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen
But he is. He won‚Äôt talk to us. [NAME] damnit OP answer us!!
No, it's just that OP made that part up. The article didn't say anything about femenists.
Sex is not a right! Porn is not a right! Viewing naked female bodies is not a god damn civil liberty!
Yeah, no
The parents are ‚Äúretards‚Äù for not watching their kid near water.
By taking it as a nonserious game you don't need in order to enjoy and have fun with it.
I've always wanted to eat Youngstown State's mascot
It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
Great program, the wife and i have been able to pay down 10k in debt in 3 months since moving our daughter into the program
Ask him if he wants to a warm glass of shut the hell up.
Your loss. [NAME] is an excellent chef, and all of his restaurants are amazing.
The fact that you got a kill with the auger is impressive enough...here‚Äôs an upvote
Wow? Thanks so much for the knowledge, sir. We owe you one. 
Even [NAME] got sick of grunge
I hate to sound like we're in a Santa Monica coffee shop, but keto diets are incredibly effective if you can stick to it
I honestly would start at the beginning. Most things are still funny because you remember the events they make fun of.
Idk how to use any.... the 5th one looks scary
Literally loving this. Where are all the guys like you irl?!
You don't even deserve my attention anymore. Bon voyage sucka
OMG thank you. Just thank you all
Nah it's just weird that they wouldn't try diazepam first since it's so often used.
"[NAME], I've told you already. ""Muy gorda chica"" does not mean ""very pretty girl"" "
Glad I‚Äôm on my way out through ATL instead!
Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.
Fellow [NAME] fan, reporting in. She's my favorite character in the series lol. 
[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated.
Do you find yourself depressed a lot? I feel like depression comes out of boredom.
I'm hoping it's more statistical noise at this point still, but it's definitely worrying.
> Because I was a disgracefully gullible, immensely stupid fucking dipshit ~~was~~ *am* FTFY
Thats awful, I'm so sorry for your loss
"That's not correct. The ""Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area"" includes Durant, as it does Athens. "
What game do you think that is ? Because that'd be Tetris or Minecraft my dude, not your teenage greasy neckbeard crap. Sorry.
I haven't ever considered my dense moments could be hormonal! That sounds like something I'd do, haha.
I don't think that option in ranked would be a good idea.
What type of migraine do you think it is? Hope you get better soon
Be careful with the Washington Times. It's not exactly the Washington Post.
Why don't you just tell us? We're all dying to know!
Yea its really dissapointing
That's the idea, don't be so indignant that I called out your bs.
I tell them I've been a fan since the very beginning of the franchise, so there's no way I could be a bandwagoner
I believe it
It's a song reference. The lyrics were awkward so one of my FB friends made a meme
Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.
My hero!
This is all I can think about when I see these things. Most of them cannot be properly washed.
Hell yeah!
Lol it's a bit of both I think.
No.. This dudes a little wack in the head
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
Ah, so you're the reason people hate aspies. 
Almost the same Win% as [NAME]. Nice.
This is the best thing I've seen so far in 2019. As a gamer and a human being this is love in video form üòä
That's not really a solid method.
A different joke. Scenic!
Weird flex but okay
Fantastic news for supply - hopefully it translates to less pressure on rents. This market desperately needs more supply and this is great news.
Like I said please have a great day !
Yeah lol like I'm cool with signing/drafting DL but pls not in the first like 3 rounds lol, much less at 2.
Right there with you! Unladylike was so depressing, I couldn't keep listening to it.
Which three of you motherfuckers changed it from 666 upvotes when I clicked on this post?
That... That makes a lot more sense than what I thought they were chanting.
Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? 
Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
Lol, good luck! Hope it goes well for you (I have no idea how it‚Äôs working at all for me)
Well then why are some people allowed to talk about strip clubs here and others are not?
It's like [NAME] said. They get motivated by a bad loss, they win a game, get unmotivated, and lose badly again
This person is a god damn idiot
I mean, none of us think it‚Äôs an insult. You don‚Äôt need to explain that.
I don‚Äôt owe you an explanation. I‚Äôm at work.
Thank you for your service o7
Laughed. Out. Loud
Breathing out like a dragon keeps me from gagging when i brush the back of my tongue
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
that's the point
Damn, I need to find this trade school which lets you make your personal animals
I admitted to myself that I had no other reason to think [NAME] was real. Kind of tough to stay [RELIGION], after that. 
So many of Pokimane‚Äôs fans are creepy 30+ year olds. I feel so bad for her.
I will definitely keep this is mind and thank you for the great comment!
> 1 in 4 women will be victims of sexual assault. 4 in 4 idiots will believe this without proof.
These are completely unrelated. Please review
Yep, I guess this is a no-go for me. Thanks!
Oh, goodness!
Ok you're right, I amend my statement to give one to anyone who wants one and can meet certain qualifications. Just like getting a business permit.
I came back to work and I found the charlkboard like this. No idea how it got that way. Weird.
Not my text lol? Im sorry dude your a weirdo and the downvotes have demonstrated that lol
Ah yes, Plastique Tiaras drag race, thank you so much izzy....noriega <‚Äî That explains alot!
hes doing it for his kid
He was an awful HC, is in his 70s and has repeatedly said he doesn‚Äôt want to do it again. 
I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
Bruh cake happy day
Oh, I see. I must have mis-read that. I am sorry.
Please never don't not reproduce.
Don't understand the question. Obviously you make up the rules in the middle of the game.
But the alt right love him! /s
Dude, there is nothing you can do against a team shooting like that, nothing. And out shooting is really good too.
Yawn. They‚Äôre toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
they seem confident and chill
I am so pleased for you that you are going for therapy. You can really benefit from it. I wish you the very best for the future.
Yeah, I completely agree. I was just making fun of this sub for seeming like they only want girls wear hoodies lol.
Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
Horrible waste of time.
I'll second this notion. One of the first things to go is texting when I start getting sad.
But all this does is hurt the average person not the right way to raise money.
Still, it‚Äôs legal weed. Sorry, sad [NAME] here..
Good thing I don't watch porn lol
Gonna get a cheeky nandos with the mandem
>Allow insurance to not pay for treatment of diseases with known vaccinations and to raise rates on antivaxxers *Genius!*
I dont like to give out my number before meeting. Maybe phrase it in terms of verbal convo.. eg phone,Skype etc
I'm so glad the Ontario government sold off that money pit. /s
Says nothing about a 2nd interview
there's no limit when it comes to owning dogs.. more dogs = more love
It's not a shaving cream ad, it's razor blade ad, you dunce!
I went to college to get an MRS and all I got was this lousy BS!
"What ""same thing""? You're not addressing any of my actual argument and have barely been doing so for a while."
I gagged at unwashed zebra hoodie.
I can totally see it. I‚Äôd be very interested to see them interact.
Oh lol. Thanks for the clarification. I just thought that‚Äôs the texture of the tongue.
I figured, just thought I‚Äôd throw it out there. Love you :)
[NAME] is amazing how dare you
My condolences. Lost my cat Zoey over a year ago. I still miss her like crazy. she was only 3 years old too.
It's also one of the very few decent solo FPS released this year.
I was linked the unarchived link and it has some important updates. Wish the OP wasn't so salty and linked the actual
I read it on NRK as well. Brought tears to my eyes.
Aren't they concerned about your weight now?
yeahhh fellow new shift here too * high five *. Congrats!
Holy hell I hate them so much.
Measuring my life in semesters filled with classes that are entirely worthless but I need a $60,000 piece of paper to get a job 
Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.
It‚Äôs deeply bizarre.
You need HELP!
One of his most underrated and nostalgic songs ever. This song has a special place in my heart.
I'm flying home to stl tonight. Land at 8pm. Have to get all the way down 44.....fuck.
Maybe check the song title one more time chief. Love the song tho. Also today‚Äôs a Scared of the Dark kind of day for me
Damn MLM at its worst
And butt. I can't believe butt cracks are blurred in US shows!
Sorry im a french guy
I review you - *clap clap* - [NAME], bye bitch, gone
This is amazing to think about and love that [NAME] is there. 10/10
Such a nasty woman
you beat me to it. Take your fucking upvote
I used to love watching movie reviews and video essays. But it‚Äôs seems like I can‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore
But it's accurate. The other link states he was living in one of the poorest provinces in China. Dude was just an idiot
Yeah it sort of sucks now.
This was posted, word for word, on r/CrazyIdeas not too long ago. It's a joke
Wow, they are actually struggling against the Hawks for 3 full quarters. 
This sub is turning into r/childfree so fast. I actually love kids and want to adopt someday. I want to mod this sub smh
Actually made me feel worse. Kids are always back there, death would have been guaranteed had they any.
Beautiful shot. It goes through my back yard every day.
My stylist is a fit, handsome guy with big, sexy hands. Can't say I don't like it when he tousles my hair.
Umm Hmmm. Too bad [NAME] can't be reached via Ouija Board. People really need his help.
[NAME] hoping he's [NAME] mum
Shit she doesn‚Äôt want = ‚Äúcurated beauty box‚Äù ü§î
I will not be preposition shamed. but yeah, you're right
fuck the caps!
Thanks i hate it.
They lead a bad defense though. And [NAME] isn‚Äôt blameless here, he‚Äôs not good against the run.
They are dumb 43 / 37 year olds.
Season 3 onward, pretty much anything with [NAME] makes me laugh. My fav character for sure. 
Honestly- my period stopping is one of my favorite ‚Äúold lady‚Äù things! Ha!
I know how it feels being in the hospital alone, I hope you get well soon
Incorrect. I'll go with what [NAME] tells me thanks.
This momentum control by the refs is killing us, and we're letting it
he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.
Well to be fair, playing the whole game would be a great start. Winning puck battles would also help. 
This is why, when I do it, I'm gonna do it as quick and brutally as possible. This is inhumane.
Hey, I share a birthday with a legend!
You have too many knives, I don't trust you. Sociopath.
Plus [NAME] has won before. [NAME] is a perennial loser. All he has ever done is played on teams that were the worst in the NHL.
About as serious as my plans to marry a porn star and retire to the Bahamas.
It means >![NAME] is the only one really close to Dutch now.!<
And suck this guy off at the same time
She liked the picture too so it‚Äôs even better. Like she really does not give a shit hahaha
And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
Uncle doods is awesome.
Didn't notice the date, sorry.
I love this so much
Yay let‚Äôs get nice and pissed
No no no i didnt learn about that in my middle school bio class so it can't be real üò§
You were at a casino. Sounds like you won.
Sorry, I‚Äôm just so hungry right now 
[NAME] in Richardson gets my love.
Watching porn on your phone is a thing people do now? It's such an inconvenient thing to do tbh.
Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun.
Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help.
Seek out a therapist? It sounds quite depressing n I wouldn't want it overwheming me.
Agree with that XI but sad that [NAME] is our best choice.
I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.
this is amazing
Congratulations, it is satire!
Its soooo cringy that I had to watch it again
I miss the Scottish [NAME].
Classic imperialism at its finest
Hope you enjoy it! Try not to leave it too long though, it's been taken down before. 
I like this template, it makes me happy.
Both are on the right though.
Ha that‚Äôs amazing you may know my little brother he graduated around that time name is [NAME]
Be adult Pay taxes to govt Be deemed incompetent by people with different views Feels bad
It's seriously terrifying!
[NAME] woke up, it was all a dream, he was really looking forward to King [NAME] visiting Winterfell. They had a good time
The wonderful thing about ttigers, is ttigers are wonderful things!
Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
Oh wow, I feel bad for the parents, they had no idea
Bring on the mosquito to destroy those tired legs
Oh man, glad I'm not watching this with my extremely emetophobic mother 
In draft I see a lot of enchantress. Even without Enchantress if Lodestone Demolition gets 6 dmg(same as Lightning Strike) I am happy.
Yay we start off with the love triangle!
Well the three games is all we have to go off of, and he was bad.
> That shit happens all the time with cabs. No. It does not
Hi, [NAME]! I just wanted to stop by and wish you peace and happiness! -HappyFriendlyBot
Thank you. It happened suddenly. Near the end of the game.
I‚Äôm telling ya, we really need to impose a basic hockey knowledge test to post here. I‚Äôm sick of the mouth breathers.
Haha. Fucking banana stand. Didn‚Äôt realize people actually used them.
So what is then, the race of western peoples? You're treading in very problematic territory friend
i understand that means i will have no luck for compensation
This is actually fascinating. I actually love this. Please don't call the cops.
Love the [NAME]. They have a great dynamic and it looks like a genuine friendship.
Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup.
I dunno...it was used for a meme and it's very fun to look at
Gave ya an upvote but sadly, by reading this thread its not going to help
Ik some of my fav episodes of recent
Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
It‚Äôs fine. Baby boomers are always angry
You're a mean person.
are you printing labels through ebay/paypal/other online service? You get a discount there. If you're paying retail, stop it. 
Welcome back [NAME]!! You sexy Brazilian SON OF A BITCH
Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing).
Not the fact that it's a terrible comparison?
[NAME] just saw ur cosplays, you prove that attractive people dont go on inceltears. Thanks for the chuckle my insecure friend
Sadly no, everything was thrown around the room, and everytime I rebuilt something, it would be annihilated again.
"""look at you... look at you..!"" Oh, I'm bawlin. "
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
Congrats dude!
!!!!! Best girl
Upvote for you, and shared the cleverness with my wife!
And wr is not what I want us to focus on anyways. We got plenty of other needs
What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
Oh, exploitable
Except it destroyed 76% of America's scooby snack production. May Shagster have mercy on us all.
UNCLE RADITZ IS PISSED!!!
I‚Äôll defer to your experience then.
Yeah no, I don't support people being questioned by police for any opinion actually, a sentiment I expect many people on here share.
Be the change you want to see in the world!
üòÖ I wrote that to indicate tears of relief and happiness but what I was actually doing was laughing like a lunatic knowing that I wasn‚Äôt alone.
How old are you? It sounds like 90% of the guys you know who are your age also don‚Äôt have their shit together
My fianc√© had it custom made as an early Valentine‚Äôs Day gift!
You have to be trolling because I doubt you‚Äôre this dumb.
I'm not saying your analysis is wrong or not based on evidence, just that the data it generates is not useful. 
I loved how [NAME] feels like everyone in the office is her family. Her relationship with [NAME] is so cute and innocent
"Exactly. I forget what the ""killed per year in a school shooting"" figure is but it's shockingly low."
Fabies? fababies? fatbabies? but fat babies are so cute.
Yet again; totally missing my point.
So we should stop caring about other people and only look out for ourselves. That DOES sound like a baby boomer!
He will, they both look totally re-integrated. If not, they'll thrash the rockets bench guys lol
"""In valor, there is hope"""
Not that I fully disagree but this seems a lot more like a rant that you want people to back you up on rather than a genuine question.
[NAME] damn, she must fuckin‚Äô STINK.
I must break you!
[NAME] is bae, how dare you.
Any differing opinion that exists is heresy.
I don‚Äôt understand why people give gold to crossposts. You deserve all the upvotes.
Accurate ! Thanks
I just had a panic attack!
You‚Äôre right, my bad
You have no right to be there waiting to be nudged.
No need to apologize. It definitely put things in perspective. I‚Äôm just glad your DD ended up ok.
I dont believe shit until america confirms the transfer.
Oh boy this aged poorly
**Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.
He‚Äôs one of the calmest goalies I‚Äôve ever seen in general haha
100% scam
Damn, we barley made it out of the Rockets game with a win according to that graph. 
[NAME] has played really well though. Arguably better than [NAME]
[NAME] is in Valkyrie, we're SAAAFFffffeeeee........
I'm gonna guess other people in the Texans org don't feel he deserves the credit you're giving him.
Man, this is awesome but seems bittersweet after NYE. It was loud as hell.
My rabbit had one just like this before she passed. I hope the animal is okay.
Hear eagles fans are sending dude money. He'll need it. I'm hoping I hear of his unemployment momentarily.
[NAME] was pretty good too. Cuah was the best 10 tho
Ireland because Ireland. Not me but i did something pretty scary.
Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition
The guilt of sin represses all
Don't grab another slice of pizza. Maybe if they would've eaten the crust they would have not been so hungry. It's greedy and picky.
>testing teenagers for four mystery roles Oh good lord. This is going to be even worse.
I wish my family was a gov so I could charge random people on the street for my family's mess ups :/
That magazine cover after her first surgery was awful. She got a chin implant or something I think. Receipt:
You win one internet!
Yep - did so for Jane the Virgin and Lost.
Well that took a turn real quick!
Ok this makes more sense now.
This post is not going to age well.
You're pushing me to adopting irrational and nonsensical beliefs! dogs are cats now!
Don't like having different stripe profiles on the shoulders to the front of the shirt. One or the other.
Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven‚Äôt settled down yet, there‚Äôs no hope for me
> Men are. Women are. People are. > > Soon. I love you
Lol. Your dad made me laugh. Tell him thanks.
Ahhhhhh [NAME] had to finish that. But beautiful pass from [NAME]
Thank you for your time and effort! I'm going to actively focus on enabling my Rein and tracking enemy ults.
You‚Äôve got to do it! Just imagine all the bitter responses that you can then share with us!
Bro, highmountain looking sick
He sounds like a stand up guy. I want his attitude in the clubhouse for sure
Not any harder than in chicken wings, imho.
Arsenal FC the retirement home... No thanks [NAME]
You might have better luck
Maybe you just don't like women that much...
You'll feel better about yourself if you don't act like an asshole to people who care about you.
Thank you for that ! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs just not me !
People are barbaric even though they are peaceful? You‚Äôre not making any sense.
His work schedule is pretty consistent so I should be able to move out when he's at work. Thanks for your advice.
Sorry if Im slow here but what does Milan or [NAME] have to do with this? Hes going to Inter or Arsenal,no?
scared for sure... scared of how much money we're gonna have to pay him it's gonna be all the moneys
Damn girl, Stockholm syndrome is strong with you. All I can say is I wish you all the best.
don‚Äôt doubt us, we really love [NAME]
Because sloppy seconds is a childish concept and I dont see bargain basement girls.
Then fling baseless insults at me. Youre doing great.
Stupid play.
Yeah it's only been posted 30 times already
Of course. I'm glad you were able to revisit in a healthy manner.
Shits me no end mate, good on you for doing something
I‚Äôm really starting to like that kid
Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
Uhhh... unfortunately I can't read the article due to some regulations...but pretty sure that post is just the article
Love it.
I was streaming on my laptop so I could watch the glorious win. Sadly hunting has been tough so far. Damn those Bison.
This is a terrible tip. Please think before doing something like this.
I still hated the system though. I felt penalized for using anything that wasn't the power beam the entire game.
Haaaaay it‚Äôs the NAGR Guy!!!!!
Want to get a hangover there üëçüï∫‚ù§Ô∏è
CHUCK THE WAGONS MAMA IM GOING WEST
Wasn't meant to be. Que Sera Sera.
see im on here having fun meming on all yall basement dwellers, stay salty 
Poor cat got his ass kicked by a crab, rope and broom.
thats just an unpopular opinion, and legally wrong.
Not cameo, reference sorry
My poor baby
yeh and the new ones just feel like reskin cod games sadly
A year later the store closed because they don't know how markets work
Your husband sounds both smart and kind. Good for you. (says she with a big smile)
"I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
youre a disgusting piece of filth.
*The Daily Wire.* Lol.
Yep. Seriously painful to read
Then do it [NAME]. It's basketball. You can do whatever you want out there.
Motherfucker!!
Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt available in my location. But thank you for trying to help me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Worried it will be taken off the table?
I feel terrible but I do this too, or watch obese people doing mukbangs
Nah, share it then down vote it in to oblivion.
Cop is stupid for upholding the law, I think most people here would beg to differ but wtfdik
The whole post reeks of troll.
FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
thats one impressive car!!
I was, and it's not. He's mad that someone posts articles he disagrees with. Pathetic and his fury is deranged 
nearly 9 minutes?! no wonder you're getting downvoted lol
And then get frustrated when they realize the internet isn't censored and then call for censorship.
Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life 
Yeah, it‚Äôd be weird to have two green arrows running around. 
[NAME], she really is my least favorite queen I drag race history. Boring, try-hard, and busted makeup.
i feel this
It's ridiculous people blind fellow faith here in algeria
I had an urge today. Went straight to the gym. Problem solved. Find something to replace your urges with
You said it wrong.
I‚Äôm glad not too much time was put into this
Thanks! Will give them a call!
Colts fan here. [NAME] seems like a nice enough guy but, holy crap, terrible coach. Buyer beware.
As ironic as it sounds but her being a non factor is what ultimately won them the game (compared to inting [NAME])
Thanks for the advice, but I think I'll stick around for a bit.
Good dog.
You fool you're using logic on a show that is clearly not bound by any
"She always says the most basic things""wow he hit him"" and her lisp is pretty annoying."
We'll try this... I love you man. Whoever you are I know you're good. Most of us are.
I was hoping that wouldn't be the case, that really sucks man. Hope you find something that ignites your passion again!
[NAME] is actually a terrible player
Oh [NAME], even if I had a bf I would be ashamed to have him do that for 
> Places of business need wider tables and open seating Open-plan Offices are a Disaster.
Lol for the past 2 weeks I wondered if an unpopular opinions thread should go up and I was hesitant for the same reasons. Lol mind reader sis
Came to say the Ravens. I always pull for them no matter what for your laid or reasons. Plus their black and purple jerseys are so nice.
About fucking time ordering ASAP
I second this sentiment! This has bothered me since the beginning and I don‚Äôt know if she really grasps how incredibly offensive this is!
damn it, you beat me to it.
I think you misunderstood me. I wanted to say that it was beyond stupid üòä
You DO seem nice. And friendly!
Ferrets are such good ESA's though! Good for you at least, I love ferrets with all of my heart.
This is just sad. So, so sad.
‚ÄúGot caught talking about meditation‚Äù Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
I have trouble even remembering what true happiness feels like
Destroyed property is the same as lynching someone for their race.
I imagined this whole scene in my head with you played by a young [NAME]. Brilliant.
You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you.
Lol good talk
Thank you Dad, very cool!
What happens when a Jedi gets PTSD? Play this game to find out. Hint: ITS FUCKIN BAD NEWS SON
You‚Äôre looking at clocking out of work two hours after you should have been finished, lol.
Seek help.
[NAME], I love science.
? What do you mean? This is my favorite video game.
yup today hit me extra hard since im unemployed. i feel like im not meant to work, or meant to do anything really!
Good question... maybe it has something to do with expanding their international flights? Although if I remember correctly they unload you somewhere else to go through customs.
I ended up with my kneecap dislocated like that back in the 80‚Äôs (it was a tragic hackysack accident). 12/10 would not recommend.
It's both we only have like 5 good players and two of them are just a rookie and a sophomore
Here's my [NAME]. and [NAME] in front of our tree :)
BUT I STILL HAD ALL THEEEEEESE
You must be fun at parties
[NAME] damn it [NAME]!
Love how she actually cross referenced the picture with the POTUS.
Ahhh thank you! This is only my second scripted video. The rest are just me babbling into the mic about art
I'm not sure if this is /r/titlegore or /r/nextfuckinglevel But I approve.
HOLy SHIT I HAVE KADRI IN MY POOL
It's definitely alive. Not sure it's doing quite so well...for 99% of people anyway.
"Eh. People really are judgemental towards ""hoes"", so I don't blame them. What is stupid is to shame people for having sex."
It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. It's usually started by injuries too.
I didn't believe it until I saw a video with creepy music. CREEPY. MUSIC. That's when my eyes were opened.
Ugh. Gross
I feel I should do this even after living here for 7 years, I've barely done any touristy things! Shame on me.
Sounds nice owo
I agree with this statement
Honestly scared to see what happens
all 10‚Äôs left tbh hoping for a clarity win, we found love second, rather be third, and titanium fourth
Anyone who complains about being a loser is a loser.
OMG kids are dying from polio??
Shucks, that's 11am for me. I might drop in one day when I don't have work. Thanks!
It‚Äôs like bombs over Baghdad to a whole new level... I LOVE IT!!
That's a classic. You have good taste.
Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way 
If you're more concerned about a potential person than an actual person, you should get out of medicine. You aren't qualified.
I like him a lot but I assume he would be a prime piece in any trade for a LD.
I love [NAME], but I'd trade him for equal time at equal cost from Trout before I took half a breath.
It‚Äôs the world record egg!
The ochils are the only plus side to living in Clackmannanshire. Plus easy travel to anywhere in scotland
At SkyZone with the kid getting some energy out. Next up is a dentist visit...ugh
Haven't noticed this comment before but, fcking [NAME], [NAME] really has become a household name hasn't she...?
What, again? This stupid country!
As bad as the session was, I really do love your drow bard she sounds super fun to play with
Nice try. That doesn‚Äôt work though.
Yay, cold McDonald's. My favorite.
I almost hit the arrow in the screenshot
heck
Thank you for such kind words.
Not evenly proportional, and not what I said. I'm talking just overall shape for proportion. I like a mom belly.... They're pretty sexy.
I'm not talking about [RELIGION] anymore though...
Imagine knowing the world was going to know you're going through puberty, with pictures! And thanks! Huge online comic fan. 
Because it‚Äôs possible. My partners mother had it and she passed very young as a result.
Ah, that's a tryptan, that can have more pronounced effects indeed.
Super fake news. This wasn't brought up when directly asked about it in previous testimony.
Damn that's a good-looking pizza
Thanks for the heads up, I'll wait until next week to head down. 
That was brilliant üòÇ
It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
If you need a friend to talk to, I am open.
Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice.
Finally gonna get together with [NAME]. Love is beautiful.
It's already the 2nd here, but happy new years! üéâ
Actually [NAME] had the #1 PP who bazooka [NAME] fired lol
The article didn‚Äôt use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
Haha thank you for all of this! I‚Äôm sorry you can relate to it all, you stay safe out there!
Spiders in the corners of the house and praying mantis' on the curtains, best anti fly setup ever.
Not looking for anything serious ‚â† rejection
This looks really cool. r/twobestfriendsplay would love this.
I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
I love it
### Because Shaggy IS such a powerful being
I would be interested in some of this stuff. Would love to see if posted here
No. This simply is not the case
This is so sweet üñ§
I don't even wear a shirt in the day around the house. Way too hot.
You‚Äôre a women hating racist. That‚Äôs what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise
Guys message got deleted, what did he say? 
[NAME]. When my ex and I discussed baby names, I feel in love with this combo
Oh forgive us for trying to make an exciting atmosphere at our homecourt.
Drugs are a hell of a drug...
Please don't.
This truly is the best a man can get.
[NAME], stop being [NAME].
What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
How does that get past the health department? Birds are filthy. Half cooked birds wing is disgusting.
[NAME] thats real? I'm so glad i unsubbed from pics
You just worded it badly, like we all SHOULD want to see it change, which many of us don‚Äôt.
Giving gold is like a thank you irl, just go out and start thanking people OP.
Say thos: mom, dad, she's busted. Respect my wishes!
I know he will be, I'm just nervous. His face is just going to be so sad üò¢
Anyone want adopt a dog while we are at this discussion lol?
I‚Äôm sorry you are feeling so down friend, that is really difficult. I hope find a way to feel better.. maybe go to emergency care...
Happy to assist with the credit repairs. I've been in the industry for over 20 years. It takes time but it's fixable.
I was thinking that as well after I posted. Some nasty stuff settles on ceiling tiles.
It just never got weird enough..
Thank you for charging your fucking phone!
I cried I was laughing so hard
I live in Suiderstrand, which is past Aghulas, no option for fibre here unfortunately :(
It sounds like you'd have a great time with Final Fantasy XIV.
Ok thanks bro for the opinion. I‚Äôm trying to settle a argument.
the trend was that i didn't really like any of them. Turns out i was just desperate.
Turn undead is once per short rest, you can‚Äôt make use of it frequently, no wonder the dm was frustrated
Me and the hubby watch every friday. Lol
I‚Äôm not a republican
It's a god awful feeling. It's changed me a little, but time heals wounds.
It didn‚Äôt help [NAME]. He should have invested in a crosscut, it might have been a bigger challenge to put back together
The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me.
He was such a pet!! Beautiful looking dog
DONT BE NEEDY. TALK TO OTHER GIRLS.
The last three words any redditor wants to hear lmao
Sorry, I‚Äôm out of the loop- are they on this season as well? I forgot about them
Goddamn right!
There is no way around it :(
7x04 for me, but I like the positivity. It was one of my best episodes of the season.
They were not [NAME] and they don't know the identity of them !
Shouldn't have insulted chungus like that, if I see you in the fog you gon get facecamped
I'll look into it, thank you! :)
This is accurate. Source: MA resident who works in CT. (WHY DON'T YOU HAVE REFLECTIVE ROAD MARKERS?!)
LUL, this is the 3rd time that Ajax has lost team on Busan. Unlucky.
I can see how you feel , THIS DID NOT TEACH A CHILD TO RESPECT ANIMALS and im ashamed and upset honeslty no horse deserved that.
> Society usually paints men as emotionless, cold, and self sustaining creatures who don't need affection. Not really, though.
I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you but it‚Äôs I can imagine I know if it was me I would forever feel Guilt.
Is this a [NAME] reference. I feel like it is.
This made me smile so hard. I am happy for you. May we all find our own happy and worthy constellations üíï
I saw the video. It was more awkward than anything.
He's transcended fuck-you-money to fuck-me-money territory
Thank you for this. It sums up exactly what I wish I could send to all my TBM family
"""Cute dog, what's his name?"" ""[NAME]"" ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)"
Idealogues are annoying.
I am just attracted to mouthy Jersey girls, what can I say? I am a masochist.
Of course not.
Because it was a cool video it was sweet, and because it was a fash it was bitter. Simple as that.
So sad‚Äîbut not surprising. It would be interesting to know if there‚Äôs a difference between countries with and without socialised health care.
Yeah [NAME] is actually really cute and nice but best boi and best girl goes to [NAME] and [NAME]. Just kidding. [NAME] all the way
[NAME] deserves to play for a proper club ffs.
How many gallons do we need is my favorite so far. The sad part is that it was always pleasant.
I don‚Äôt think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
I need like a drawn out visual or something
Looks expensive. Hope you enjoyed the game!
Awesome. Never get sick of hearing stories like that
So his aunt? I think I followed that.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!!!
Damn. Alright.
Oh thank god, the TV is safe.
I'm not crying, you're crying
Thank you!
Thanks for clearing this up!
It creates perverse incentives. Allow underpaid prison labour and suddenly you've an incentive towards exploiting your prison population rather than rehabilitating them.
You would LOVE this big mutt. He's a doll.
Oh my [NAME] I completely didn‚Äôt realise. I‚Äôm so sorry
That‚Äôs awesome. Feed the gators while getting rid of Pits. Kill two birds with one stone.
i cant i have asthma
Born in Jersey, live in Kansas. I love my Lions. I was also 5, hated the Giants and liked the Lions unis. 
It‚Äôs like you guys actually **want** a dictator.
The true horror of modern democracy is enabling those who say pork roll to have a voice.
To me the cringe is the American woman's love for his fascism. (since no one knew what was happening to the [NAME] in 1936)
Honestly at this point they need to do that or adjust [NAME] 3d model. The command grabs literally go thru opponents constantly, it looks weird as hell
Why would we sign [NAME] when we already have a full time shortstop and third baseman?
*price hike for [NAME] only. I dropped Netflix last month because of it.
Goddamnit [NAME] back at it again...
Demonize - to portray as wicked and threatening. It's not hard to demonize someone when they regularly demonize themselves.
There‚Äôs a weird [NAME] version of this where the person falls and finds [NAME]
You are not yet worthy to possess this knowledge. Watch the film and you may be rewarded.
Yes I heard abt the f bombs! That has to be why. Thanks for your reply:) until then hubby and I will anxiously wait üòù
Awesome. Thanks!
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
Boooo!!
You hang your head in shame. Not because of this, but just in general.
I would of at least helped the poor guy. Throw some fire crackers at the dam thing
Yeah its too bad that there was someone at a university who wanted to research this and he got shut down.
Yes I love that show! I need to watch the last episodes now that I think of it
Scenes like these are what make me wish I could forget the entire show at will. So I can watch and enjoy them all over again.
They understand alright, they just don't give a shit. Bunch of fucking scum.
Idk which is worse. The guy doing the project or me watching the video.
Listen to it while you're sad
I‚Äôve started the journal part! But I unfortunately need to wait until he gets more aggressive for them to act on it.
Being the best [NAME] in SC2 was like being the best [NAME] in basketball.
Man... it‚Äôs been a while since I laughed so hard watching one of these vids
That sucks :( are you guys still in good terms though?
The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.
2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. 
Freedom? Not in New 2013 and it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse since
That sounds wonderful.
Cause schools the world over teach a unit about Alaska. OP is an oaf who's never left their hometown.
Well, I was going to surprise you [NAME], but what the heck...I‚Äôm gaining a bunch of weight to go on disability!
SC6 has a colourful cast and is actually very easy to get into. So yeah man, go for it.
He has the maturity of a 2 year old and you are right...ugly in his soul.
It was understandable, but it was comically basic. He just wanted to take over Earth for Darkseid IIRC. 
Oh...this is the one time... Yes I can assure you none of those outlets print satire without labeling it as satire or opinion
[NAME] comment has me laughing
"""We lost good people on both sides"""
Probably out of desperation as they going no answers with the other made up god.
"Sorry i was thinking of the word ""Plaintiff"""
Brilliant post!
Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that‚Äôs completely false. 
*youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*
Stranger things have happened, but still, good luck.
Damn, politics *does* make strange bedfellows.
Man, I can't remember if this started on r/NBA or r/MMA
[NAME] bringing on Sir [NAME] to confront [NAME] about calling him fat is a great interview
"not really. but those people that go out of their way to say stuff like ""have a blessed day"" or whatever kinda creep me out. "
I agree. That is a fight better left for later.
Go look up China‚Äôs virtual news anchor.
And yet, it‚Äôs bad to manipulate people. Which is what the in laws are doing. 
u/TheQTVain praying for your little fighter. Hope everything goes well and he comes out in good health. Stay strong and let [NAME] do his thing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hopefully they got a chance to see [NAME].
Dr [NAME] is so adorable. I just want to give him a hug then ask him to make a diet for me.
"""UGH FEMINISM!!! SURELY THATS THE REASON I CANT GET LAID!!!"" see you in hell "
Yeah feel bad for people paying 200 to watch this crap. Better hockey watching my sons novice games.
I don't know how you get over the survivor's guilt after something like that.
I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
Auch, that's gotta hurt...
Hedonism at it's finest
[NAME]. Gun crimes are pretty much unheard of on that side of the pond, isn't it? RIP.
I don't think pairing [NAME] and [NAME] again is that bad an idea. Also love the [NAME] idea.
Even more so. It would only make our prison (this world) even more diabolical.
*alligator point, thank you
I fear it is already too late if he already uses words that should hurt but really don't because of their misuse.
If he doesn‚Äôt give it a ten I‚Äôm gonna riot
It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.
Lol. I realize that. I know plenty of people like y'all
Thank you noodle, very cool!
She‚Äôs a [NAME] also, but I doubt that means much in the entertainment business..
They come to your house and rob you at gun point. Be honest. What are some ways that this could be resolved?
Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? 
That's amazing, wow! People can be so good.
I probably just watched whatever episode someone else is rewatching.
Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society.
Love that lane. It's like the best part of Rome.
It's funny how the mention snoop at the end of the article, reminded me of the chappelle's show episode about [NAME]
Finally I feel like it‚Äôs been ages. Dude needs to really beef up this offseason don‚Äôt focus on anything else.
[NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] just yelling over each other and [NAME] looking around like what the...?
yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball
Welcome to the future, kid. Unfortunately your mom isn't coming.
Thanks for sharing
Thank you :)
Then let's go scythe and HAMMER!!! I've actually wanted scythe and hammer for the longest too
I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
Did the burglar win? It's fine and all that he tried sueing, if it actually worked is the important part. 
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
You know, I'm rather disappointed, but admire your cunning at the same time
Women don't want their own shit. They want our shit. ---- [NAME]
So having a baby you don‚Äôt want is [NAME] will, but having a baby you do want is going to put you in hell? 
OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
[NAME] is a fine woman leave her out of this.
This was a floating barge of bullshit bound to ignorance, which is headed for a recycle bin on my desktop.
Good edit. I was going to go on a tirade about changing diapers on my lap/bathroom floors, but now I don't need to.
Damn, that's low. 
Yea we're already in last place, those 3 missing assures nothing lol.
It's not so uplifting that it's guaranteed to die in the Senate...
"""Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male! There are already enough girl characters. We don't need a third!"""
Reading comprehensions not your strong suit I‚Äôm guessing, no I don‚Äôt personally believe that, just pointing out an anecdote.
He raped you. Leave. Now. Cut all contact. Easy answers here. You deserve far far better than this
Box up all his stuff and put it outside the door
Dogs , unconditional love 
You have no perspective. Go outside and get some friends.
I literally point out the same thing (along with everyone in the YouTube comments) and get downvoted to oblivion. Love it.
More like [NAME] stalker,lol.
I am and have dealt with the consequences, hence my amazing son. Like I said before, hopefully you don't procreate.
All armed robbers, serial killers, rapists, swindlers all downplay the severity of their actions... 
my mistake :(
Thanks for your insight random person on the internet. Did it make you feel better typing that out lol?
I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a hell or heaven.
I really wish I could scroll through comments with the video still playing.. sigh
You're taking all of this WAY too literally AND making a lot of assumptions.
He is holding you hostage. Sad state of affairs.
Why did you post my autobiography
lmao so many dumb fouls from lsu
Well, I could already do that. But glad to have BCH as a pathway
Oh, totally mistaken - thanks for correcting me! I had read differently, but maybe that's in other states/cities?
Thank you, brother.
I loved this costume and wasn‚Äôt even aware of the amount of hate it had until recently
Get in, I'll tune in now
I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record.
You got it, thanks!
No, he doesn‚Äôt. But, the people who elect our officials do. I am appalled and embarrassed that she‚Äôs a [NAME].
Cus the left doesn't give a shit about people who fought for the USA!
ah dang sorry. in that case idk.
I shouldn't be tanking this much rating after even a year bro. You don't understand how bad it feels to be in this garbage elo.
"""...And what do I find out?! There is no [NAME]. This whole team is a god damn ghost town!"""
I'm sorry. That's awful
To this day, I get nervous reading anything with [NAME] name in it
This why we can‚Äôt have nice things! I would‚Äôve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away üò§
Yea idk what to tell ya man sorry. Not sure why it‚Äôs doing that
Unreal. [NAME]- Expert level
lol @ additionally ‚Äúlearning‚Äù physiotherapy as if we DPTs/PTs didnt spend our own 3 years learning.
"I'll say no thanks to endangering others in traffic. And miss me with the ""I drive better while high"""
Ooohhh shit, they did *not* just say men should be decent human beings, they've finally taken it too far! Gather the troops! /s
Damn, 14 year olds in 2019 are bigger shits than I was when I was 14.
Damn, that was dirty.
I would point to [NAME] razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
Ah I see, thanks. I struggle with the order of the sentences in English from time to time, so I'm glad for any help :) 
True enough, I just hope there are more reasonable people than not. 
I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
[NAME] TAKE MY HEART
Because love is a lie and there is no happiness in the world
I'm so effin' proud of you! You handled it beautifully!
I thought that too, but I was wrong. And I know that full health is 170.
Nah, according to OPs limited post history, he's a pedophile. 
Nah no offence taken! Just trying to keep things civil HAHAHA, it‚Äôs all good my man. 
Thank you so much!
Lmao I feel you.
Does this really work? Any one else try this yet? I'm surprised I've never heard of this before thank you.
I can deal with pupper and doggo in moderation but heckin, hooman, fren all make me irrationally angry.
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.
I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway
I know! BTW I love your choice of critter. Penguins are fabulous.
I pirated this movie last night and can confirm: it's truly awful. Not just lacking in good, but *aggressively* bad.
Maybe you should try watching it before commenting on it, otherwise your just posting from a position of ignorance. 
It started to compute for me when I was ‚Äúright‚Äù all the time but never ended up getting what I wanted.
Lol [NAME] must have took [NAME] phone
I was just about to comment this. Do people think throwing an lol at the end of everything will just make it fine and dandy. Ridiculous lol.
I watch more Netflix on my phone than my other devices. And it looks incredibly amazing on my Samsung phone screen instead of my mediocre PC monitor.
Oh no brothers, absolutely no cheers from iraq
You bomb them and they come your way 'cause you're a real winner!/s
And trying to take [NAME] gun away. üò© Like really people, it's his weapon, find yourself one and stop trying to teach him better
I used to feel like this. That‚Äôs a mental illness man
I don't think eating 4 eggs at a time is going to clog your arteries, unless you do it like 6 times a day
**Zigzagzigal-type Balance Suggeestions** - I feel like you are flying, why not get into a war with China who, because they had no alternatives.
No point trying to hang on to players who are not committed to the club. If this is true then good luck CHO, all the best. 
That‚Äôs fun.
The register entries have allot of interesting information, and basically served as the record of service for all personnel.
Eat too many whoppers and he'll be down with the sickness. Lma0 I'm sorry
ooh man I miss OutKast. brings me back to my childhood
I‚Äôve been abused enough by the Knicks today.
What a confession! Unbelievable!
Eat healthy, get as much sleep as you can, and wear a mask when the little one comes along.
After the first sentence you were my best friend. Then came the second sentence and now I really don‚Äôt like you.
I'm too scared to start Black Mirror because it honestly seems like we might not be that far off from some of it.
None that I know of. Any mental health issue needs to be cared for like any other health issue. Doctors and medications can help.
too much logic in there for remainiacs only interested in cheering for unicorns and insulting the british people.
Leave wet puddles everywhere!
I would eat the everloving bejeesus out of that pickle.
I love [NAME] but hate Royals and wow this version is so much better for some reason.
I'm not falling for this again Uncle [NAME].
Ha me too. I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôve been called out
I would have preferred that. But he wanted the big party, which admittedly, was super fun. 
lol [NAME]
lol..You're not getting [NAME] or any of the young core..
I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
That looks like some pretty intense ‚Äúhomework‚Äù
Because it was a terrible idea.
They got ripped apart here (On Reddit) a few weeks ago for passing false information on aircraft videos and taking legit criticism poorly.
are u ugly?
Lol, that actually sounds kinda like [NAME]' rallying cry! 
Finishing peeing and then still feeling like you have to pee.
Congratulations to your organization for having good management.
If you've ever heard him speak on almost anything he's clearly extremely intelligent even if he's being crass.
She has a dirty mind perfectly fine looking cannon until she manifest the awkward scenario.
Confirmed that men are literally soulless, it's a matter until they start eating humans
I can see why! I would totally be offended too!
Completely correct. But he Might have lost control, blown a tire, etc., or maybe just panicked human error. 
You're a freak, you dirty dog you.
I love conspiracy theories with no shred of proof
Wow, great news bro!
That guy is gonna regret losing you the rest of his life. You know why i know this? Because i am him 30 years ago.
I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.
As much as I would love this kind of support, I had beef with people over EVERYTHING
[NAME] left that on purpose. Would bnever have scored
inject that shit into my veins
I feel like the world just doesn‚Äôt want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :‚Äô(
> If this article was/is false then the poster should be banned for life Congratulations. You just fundamentally changed how internet works.
I wish that was a thing üòÖ
You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams.
Bless you.
Turning the Sunny Side Up into a Shitty Side in All Directions. Love it!
We're pretty spoiled in Halifax.
i had all of those. checked myself with a GP and found out i had low iron, migraines and needed to visit the therapist re my anxiety.
This is why I clean my belly button every day. That‚Äôs disgusting
Ex Novo has a great one on their menu and probably open.
Yes, once I even deleted my account because I was so nervous about down votes. Lately,every once in a while I comment encouraging good attitude.
I took a picture of the sunrise this morning too. Just north of Austin. It was very pretty today.
Being approached isn't a license to act a racist fool yourself
No at that point you‚Äôre a POS, or just have horrible taste in women lol 
Bloody Peasant!
that's not what he's saying at that part
damn. Thanks!
Best day of the week!
The fact half the level has no fucking music is a real pain.
Ugh, I want to have his baby too...
Ha. She cried because you influenced it.
Oh i already watched the whole thing when it aired. That match was awesome! I just wanna rewatch the last 20 mins of the womens rumble
bruiser sylvanus is so op for the first 20 mins, its ridiculous. underrated support.
Her face oddly looks way narrower in this picture.
Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right.
Touche lol. Ours usually comes back pretty quickly, I think this is the longest it's been out.
I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before.
I understand it but still can't ask questions. I am too afraid
Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
2.5%? That not so great for [NAME].
> If you love that you probably also love no man sky's algorithm. I loved it back then, because it was the only game. 
im glad that's not what the game is about then
Apparently government cares about the environment about as much as many of our neighbors.
Healthier and more disgusting.
I cant even deal with this you are fighting with someone over your inability to understand a sooooooooooooooooo is sarcasm. Get some help
Glad you learned from it m8 and hopefully you are doing okay now
Thank you. For what it's worth, I absolutely am an idiot. But I am making a valid argument within the context.
I would be surprised if [NAME] doesn't let you in. I would write a letter to [NAME] and explain the situation they might make an exception.
I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
"From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
How is ot unreasonable. You take responsebility for what you breed. This natalist perversion is disgusting. The product didnt fail you. You failed the product.
It's a bitter cycle
Good luck going to jail.
The good kind
Can‚Äôt relate
Impressive to have such foresight.
Meh, same branch of religion. Just opposing views on the sequel to the story.
I wish [NAME] was fit enough to be fourth choice.
Didn't u just say ur new to this? Why are you speaking?
I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
u/Mickster19 these are incredible! We gotta have this [NAME].
Don‚Äôt like blood of the dead by the looks of it.
Not exactly the cream of the meme crop there. And on a personal note I don't think ironically bad memes are funny.
I hope barely anyone watches it, it's so aggressive, full of cringe and makes him look childish
I absolutely did and loved every minute of it. I really do hope it gets more seasons
of course you agree. you post in r_braincels.
They announce they hate Brexit first
Well...yeah. It did.
I always thought the U was for urine .. well this is going to be awkward.
You're the best kind of person. I hope that you find great family and friends in your mother's family.
Thanks for sharing that info. I'll see how low I can go. Did you do a trade in?
4 lives essentially, its insane
>it is fleshy I am horrified to learn that my flesh is fleshy
Glad there's someone on here with a little sanity.
Sorry don‚Äôt follow you.
I guess [NAME] are especially good at making heaven sound boring üòÇ. I'm also an [NAME]
Headline had me thinking the guy was currently barricaded in a BK bathroom, demanding they give him free food. But no.
Yeah take it slow..I mean you waited 7 years you can wait a bit. Hope it will turn out good for you guys
I'm doubting the teeth cleaning.
I'd love to see [NAME] in a 4-3 to be honest.
Yo your eyes are glued wide open like aderal and you move your head all the way back you are done
Which is exactly what ASIRT does...
I love when it drops, and the beat just stops. Feels like the musical equivalent to a cliffhanger 
In that case, I‚Äôm appalled. 
1. Well said. 2. I like your style. 3. Prove it.
Yup, it was a complete waste of time.
The only thing keeping me warm in this subzero temperature is my fucking hate for [NAME].
Do as I say, Not as I do
The my bad thing is hilarious.
You are delusional if you think big oil and existing deeply entrenched and rich traditional energy can‚Äôt pay scientists more money than new renewable energy can.
My anger, up 50%. 
Sicko mode is on a whole new level, it cant be compared.
When people don't understand things they invent gods. how little we have changed in all these years.
I'm pretty relaxed thanks for the concern though
Instagram literally fueles my eating disorder, I can't have it. It is all fake though
Hmm. Never saw a COMMENT downvoted!
Keep defending their failures and advocating for people to stay silent and just lie down. Good luck with that, it's unfortunately working.
*blinded by the shill* I know like 2 people unfortunately..
I hate when people Beijing a gun. Even worse when they Shanghai one.
Nope, don‚Äôt even know what dart is. Sorry. And thanks!
that sounds absolutely adorable!! im glad you had those kittens there as a distraction :)
This meme describes how I feel about 2018 pretty accurately. Cheers to a golden 2019!
You are retarded
Great story. Maybe it isn't malicious compliance, but I enjoyed it anyway. Damn companies who lack empathy for other humans.
He is like a bad cartoon that‚Äôs hard to turn off.
I'd say its higher tier stupidity because this belief actually harms people
These refs are [NAME] awful. Find a new job
Thank you for the explanation! ü¶à
Damn who is [NAME] pissed at?
If they actually want to prevent abortions, they should be fighting for universal healthcare, comprehensive sex ed, and civilized parental leave policies.
Did you look at the picture that spurred this entire conversation, genius? 
It‚Äôs legal in TX but with restrictions. Traffic has to be moving slower than 15mph and the rider cannot exceed 30mph
Wow those fruit turnovers look delicious id defo pay 3$ to have one
That's far more expensive than, you know, recycling it...
This show has completely gone downhill, can‚Äôt believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh
Your market sucks
[NAME] I love you but there is a top 15 game on
And then they say, ‚ÄúHAHAHAHHA IT WAS RIGHT THERE WOW!‚Äù
YES FUCK THE LEAFS. MAY THEY CONTINUE TO CHOKE IN THE POST SEASON.
My soul twin must be [NAME] because I‚Äôm terrified of water!
I love the creative writing that stems from this sub, so entertaining.
I don't believe they distribute to Austin.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt trust them either. 
I think he can be much, much better than [NAME]. No doubt. His length, good defense. We are talking about [NAME], right?
Since i have no one i choose u op to reach out to I love you fellow human pls always smile friend have the happiest of lives
[NAME] didn‚Äôt just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn‚Äôt a dog fighter, he is a sociopath.
You dirty scavenger
"What a fucking moronic jackass. ""This is what happened with my piece of shit dad so you have to experience it too"""
I don't know who that is so it wasn't intentional
I have and it didn't help. It's only a matter of time now for how long I can hold on.
Twilight... STILL a better love story than The Last Jedi!
"The Right: ""Why won't the left let us rape, abuse and brainwash children without putting their liberal noses where they don't belong."""
"""Holding [NAME] up like baby [NAME] would be a fantastic way to excite a fan base that‚Äôs been neglected for years."""
To drool on.
Damn its like that tv show on Netflix called You. Stay safe and hope everything works out for you.
your vehicle is pretty!
oh happy cake day
I'm just an idiot on the internet. I don't know a doggam thing.
He is and will be irrelevant. No worries.
Whatever you say, mate. Good luck trying to tell kids not to love their parents.
No I dont think I said that anywhere
"I didn't say ""do it for the children,"" but I understand if reading isn't a strong suit for you."
Wow guns and ignorance. What else is wrong with her?
Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
Dedicated agents will work without pay to see him hauled away in cuffs to visit his pal [NAME].
Lots, play store or apple store vpn. Nord is good
The fuck? Come from nothing, now something doesn't matter? 
Thank you for understanding <3
I hope last night was fun enough to warrant the hassle today.
So you spectate all the people that kill you? Stop talking bullshit.
[NAME] clan needs some fucking therapy.
Yes they do. Thank you for the idea!
Makes you wonder about the superbike which was going even faster..
Nice post here, dork.
I really only do this after a while if awkward silence, which may make it even more awkward tbh
I hate when people down vote to hell when someone has a different (yet valid) opinion
Damn... METOO
I really hope we win tomorrow. .500 halfway through the season would be insanely satisfying... also I want to win lol
This is an excellently written response, thank you for offering her your support. 
Sorry dumbass, the provision is for paid **training days** But nice try
Oh hey that's pretty cool!
Yeah no way random bubbling would get them the highest score. Even in a 50 question test the odd would be ridiculously low
Maybe? I was def too busy going ‚Äúohmygawd motherfucking KING SHARK!?! ü¶à ‚Äú to notice
Hilariously wrong and uncontroversial.
Not a single one of these allegations are of Russian collusion. It's more perjury trap nonsense.
[NAME] was not childfree. He just honored his wife's (who is childfree) desires because he loved her.
Done that. Body dysmorphia makes them look the same to me ü§∑
I hope you bundle up too, Mr. President. 
This is how I know I'll have a good time!
So we‚Äôre reposting stolen jokes now... cool
Yep because running a blower for 5 minutes caused it. Not the millions of vehicles or factories we have.
Sir the fuck down. This is an intervention, we need to talk.
The second half of the game was a big disappointment for me. I really wish they kept the family around for much longer.
So I suppose they‚Äôre more like the flying monkeys than the wicked witch?
I feel like one day you're in for the shock of your life.
I hate that you've forced me to deal with a reality I've been blissfully ignoring.
Marketing! That‚Äôs a great word to describe what they do.
Sorry, no legal advice, but that really sucks and you have my sympathy. Best of luck and determination.
People are idiots! No one should shame [NAME] for doing her job as a mom! Shame [NAME] instead for putting her kids' life in danger!
Thank you - will await your PM.
I guess that's better. I think an important aspect of feminism is that it allows idealized women to be imperfect yet exemplary nevertheless.
Wolf does have a pretty nice ass in ssbu
Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
That was such a bad yellow, he had the height and positional advantage such a bad challenge
Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts 
Thank you kind internet stranger for listening to me. I feel a little less alone for the moment.
I don‚Äôt like [NAME] very much either, but she‚Äôs not a mess here. 
You are not intereating. You are an annoying cunt who should have never been concieved.
Everybody uses your back lane. You're famous for being the local bike.
That's great! You got this!
I did not know that! I love me some quality evil dead
Yeah, everyone goes through this phase during their Junior year of high school. 
That‚Äôs it! Thank you!!
That‚Äôs sad, although I‚Äôm aware they historically haven‚Äôt been weaned off of authoritarianism.
I have over 120 hours of play time and only have like 27 achievements ü§§üò≠
Nailed it! I'm sorry you've had to deal with it. This whole mess sounds awful.
Just rubbish.
Extol is the band that introduced me to progressive metal in the first place, still my favorite genre.
Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.
You can call me a bitch, and it's cool because you also aren't expecting me to pay you for doing it.
we have a ghost who constantly knocks the ice bin off the top of the ice machine a few times a day everyday lol
This stuff is very effective tho its weird smoking the quarter of a gram gets you going
I think [NAME] has like a clothes/purse/perfume line. Don't quote me though.
Sucks to suck Ratbirds
Just subscribed! Keep strong bro focus on the end goal :)
That looks lovely, but what‚Äôs the mutant on the top?
Wasn't expecting these feels man. I'm so sorry for your loss!
I‚Äôve done pajamas before but I think sweatpants would be way too thick
I ate meat for 21 years of my life, been vegan for 7 now. This doesn't hold water.
Someone commented that it's like that friend who constantly talks about their ex, but insist they're over them.
The best music for the best voice....epic & timeless üé∂‚ù£Ô∏è
I feel shot in the heart.
Thanks for the recommendation! By this point I should just start a list. :D
Not really, it can bind *itself* (though not future incarnations) otherwise none of the laws would mean anything.
Thank you! Ill sign up as soon as its working! I checked it a few min ago and its still giving the error.
I have this too, so don't worry. We are not crazy. Just regular humans who happen to have an anxiety issue. 
i was just feeling it okay i knew it wouldn‚Äôt blow up!!!
A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
You can't control if you're nervous or not, but just know that you will absolutely be judged for it. Consciously or subconsciously.
I agree. She's a terrible model. I tried to get on board with her, but all her editorials in Vogue were so flat. 
But come on babe, you know you want me babe...l.o.l. JK Babe ;)
"Hence I used ""weird"". I know it's awkward, but it was indoctrinated into us growing up."
I look forward to it.
This was such a genius character. Even reading quotes makes me breakout laughing, every time
Downvoted before I realized what sub I was on
No one likes him enough to tell him he‚Äôs wearing women‚Äôs glasses
In our society it is more shameful to pay for sex, do drugs and to gamble than to praise the death of innocent innocent victims.
I care too much about what others think. Constantly trying to cater to their feelings or worrying about their opinions.
"I am sorry for offending you "" WoW yOu WoNt EvEn LeT mY cHiLd Go ThErE aGaIn"" how tf. Whoops didnt mean to reply lol"
I do crazy‚Äô I love to clean man. Just have fun. Or at least try.
This has been largely disproven. [NAME] had no problem dropping the bomb and knew it wouldn't change the outcome of the war.
She should kick him out... next best thing from abortion.
I‚Äôm incredibly jealous of you and yours. Congratulations. Maybe someday I‚Äôll have someone.. but I dream.
Don‚Äôt blame [NAME] there tf is he supposed to do if our wing can‚Äôt stay in front of their man
Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously.
"Now you ruined the surprise!"""
I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt come to that tbh...
don't send that message
Tbh, that sounds better than lithium
I came here to say your third paragraph. Yes OP, this is good advice and you can probably find a job pretty quickly. 
What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
Stop saying generic hating sentences!
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
Ad hominem. Ridiculous argument, not even funny or hilarious.
I think they'd do ok (Sorry but as an INTJ a lack of my thoughts here is also bothering me, too)
You're not kidding about the savage energy part. Just look at this man.
This probably not a good file to keep on your phone if you are accessing this from within...
Thanks! I'm going to Middlebury this fall but that's going on my resum√© for the rest of my life tbh
.250/.330/.460 imo. And for a team who has had no 1B since Tex, this is more than fine. 
not having periods for sure
It just so happened that PD, sick kids , and family emergencies all happened to overlap between all my coworkers leaving me all alone. 
Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
[NAME] that is frightening...
Missed that part, but now I see where you are coming from.
I remember reading this on a rage comic site 7 years ago hahaha!
Immigrant children dying in state camps? Horrible. Healthcare for the poor and eldery? Also horrible! Got it.
Banning abortion causes way more harm than good and is evil to be against. Same with requiring suffering people to suffer. you seem evil
QP is either extremely depressing or absolutely amazing. There is no inbetween.
someone who believes in facts.... thankz, this was also my understanding of how income generation works on youtube
What a nice [NAME] sentiment!
That's what is so stupid about this. My dog gets dreads on its ass sometimes when it poops. Is that appropriation?
But also don't be so aloof that you don't want to help anyone.
That's got nothing to do with anything that's happened in this thread
I will! Thanks!
I love playing [NAME] against everyone. Main fire for 2 seconds, alt fire in the head, 100üî• 
that sounds disgustingly sweet and yet i want to try it
I hope [NAME] has something cooking. I wanted [NAME] back
You were inebriated and eating ratshit.
Theres nothing more despicable in this world than a carelessly brewed mug of chai brother. You gotta get with the program.
Give me [NAME]. We need some thump when we clear the benches.
Saddos??? And holy heck that laughing emoji, what a disrespectful sociopath. I'm so sorry you have to deal with her.
Same with [NAME], she‚Äôs simply stunning at any age. 
O no shes gonna go after mandy
Sorry for your loss üò£
WON ME 1K LAST GAME IN PARLAY!!
Lol! Nope. Any muscle in your body will shrink if yiu dont use it.
I sorry didn‚Äôt want to disrespect peep but as i said i needs to be dark and about something i like
Oh, so I can go straight to hell when I die? No thanks.
Sorry man, it's not gonna happen. The music needs to be remastered for vinyl specifically and that's more than your budget.
I‚Äôd add ‚Äúcan‚Äôt host‚Äù to the list haha
The part where he carries her to the car had me howling! Poor guy was stumbling with the weight he obviously couldn‚Äôt handle
I mean, yeah, I'd complain a little. But then I'd eat the crap outta that.
Ah, thank you :D
Maybe but kids and social media and cellphones in classroom, and a pervasive culture that glorifies sports over education are ruining our education system. 
I'll definelty look into this, thank you for the advice and kind words :) 
Thank you for your post. I will always treat him the same
22 points in 41 games with a pretty shitty Utica squad, first full year in NA... yeah I don‚Äôt want another Dahlen debacle 
Just hit Leichhardt! Well, the wind has, waiting for the cool now though!
A police response is probably justified for some of the larger spiders we have here.
I'm not even going to read all of that. It is not mindboggling AT ALL. [NAME] is a huge douchebag. The end.
"For a second there I read the subreddit as ""furry and sad"". Pretty disappointed."
Ah, alright. Solid lists, but I disagree with appointing a sitting [NAME] with only 2 years under his/her belt.
Thank you so much for this link, watching [NAME] was an absolute delight! 
Adults seem to get more huffy than kids, who do go to school on their birthdays.
That's a weird answer.
Glad I could help!
It's so sad that people don't vaccinate their children. For every upvote to this post, I'll vaccinate my child in protest. 
>[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
This is so infuriating.
"Love the tilt away. ""nobody will know what I'm up to"". "
Surely it's *a* factor. It's just not sufficient. [NAME] had a good life before he went jihadi.
I was living for him. Now he left me. I'm not gonna live anymore.
You are BOTH awful people.
Nice find!
this 'bug' has caused me countless death... i always used rifle primarily and switched to shotgun after rifle shot
3:32 excuse me what the fuck.
My vanity point for my love for SS is that it has a lance lord.
I'm so proud to be british
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
DEMOCRATSPF ARE LITERALLY HITLER!!!!
At some point in the season the whole bench is about to do it lol
"[NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect ""data"" from this place."
What the fuck did I just read?
I thought that phrase was only used for memes now lol at least that's what I got from Vic deals
That was his scripted job. Fake.
when only rich people got elected and passed laws...
I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more hopeful answers.
Discord. It‚Äôs there in the FAQ.
Cheers! Let's keep it going!
picked up a desk at a great price here. They have a good selection of furniture.
Wow, sorry, bruh. I didn‚Äôt realize we were in the presence of genius. Please elaborate.
Ooh wrong answer, but you'll have another chance to win 10,000 dollars in the lighting round! Will be right back after these messages.
QB Coach too? Shit..
Holy shit I‚Äôm stupid
^ I find both creepy tbh.
I mean, your account is a day old, so I think you‚Äôll be okay.
That's pretty bizarre, BF4 has always had a strong
If I remember correctly, you can't edit a title. I'm not on the official reddit app though.
A year is way too short. You won‚Äôt know the impact of Brexit till 2030 really.
Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two
They‚Äôre so angry!
Came here to say that. I'm genuinely astounded that it's as much as 12%.
I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.
Thanks! I'll work on this next time!
Doesn't look intentional though.
Hahahah that‚Äôs actually really funny no judgment here, do you friend
This is amazing dude, literally flawless work
Gotta admit, I chuckled at this one
Gotcha. Given how contentious even the top-tiers are, I wanted to play it safe.
Fuck it, maybe the faceless men worship the great other AND assassinated the fire warlocks in valyria, hwo knows?
The mods deleted it I'm sorry
It's the top comment. How weird.
Yup. If they're brazen enough to not give a damn about the law, they're brazen enough to not care about public opinion on them.
Middle school. Puberty was rough for most of us. I was a victim and a perpetrator of a lot of stupid behavior in middle school.
School Board Trustees are leeches of the system in any district. It's the most unnecessary position that does nothing more than continuous damage.
I am also a doctor and his legs are in fact discolored. But seriously dude go to the doctor.
If this is a medical situation the analogy still applies üôÑ
I don't know why he'd take it like that, he was gone for so long so someone was going to do a show like that.
It's a troll. Look at the history.
Here in the UK I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve never seen a taco
[NAME], thank you, for being a friend.
Lmao what's the difference neither one is refrigerated. People are fucking stupid
And in the worst fashion possible.
shut up LIBTARD you right now:ü§Øüò≠ü•∫
you have captured their ugliness perfectly . GREAT JOB
Sadly I know lots of peeps that would find this dude hot. He has that LA 90‚Äôs Persian chic thing going for him
That and useful idiots.
Colts Offense is laughable right now
Leave the guy alone he‚Äôs making sidewalk angels
He probably does, but people don‚Äôt speak Godlish very well.
I thought it was funny ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Well, supposedly [NAME] wrote TPM in only a couple days, and people hated it.
My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It‚Äôs just about self control.
It's amazing that some people think that [RELIGION] will prevent all of this from happening.
Oooh, edgy!
Tbf I don't think you can get much snakier than wishing for someone's pet to die
Wow that's so litüî•üî•üî•üòÇüòÇüí¶üí¶üí¶ im so proud of your autistic son for making it LOL OUT LOUD üëèüëèüëèüí¶üí¶üí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüí¶üëèüòòüòò
(It was a joke)
Still love [NAME]. Gave his heart to the Broncos for many years. Hope he can go out and win himself another ring this year.
Everytime i see a T-Wolves game and i see [NAME] running around with the number 67 jersey on i just laugh
"we have a ""righty"" complaining about ""lefties"" making up BS, while they make up BS... sad."
>It happens plenty. Good to know. I would have expected to see it on the wiki, especially if many atheists *do* believe in objective morality.
"Oh boy.. ""The Beginner's Guide"" game on steam had me messed up for a couple days.."
Remember the year ‚ÄúSong 2‚Äù was number 2? Good times.
You‚Äôve become the very thing you swore to destroy
Outwardly projecting someone you aren't internally sounds exhausting. Hopefully coming on here will provide some form of relief for you.
I'm hoping he's just gonna psyche people out like [NAME] did with [NAME].
Very true.
Yes sir ! Cheers. I miss typed I get #120 20mg.
That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.
Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)
Either you're very high, or don't know how to construct thoughts in the English language.
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
that's one amazing thought! All the best! we are with you!
:-) Lunch with the wife on a weekday is such a special treat, even when one is under the weather.
The girl on the right got glass stuck in her leg poor girl
What I figured but needed some clarification. Thanks!
That's cause [NAME] really got his career ruined by injury.
Not sensitive, just scared that a sub I enjoy will become divided and will have in-fighting.
She must have a very boring life
I imagined a big last stand but it was just kind of a mess
I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? 
I was the following season, would have loved to see this game and the Boro final!
Bipolar symptoms tend to be very fun and exciting, but they can also be very bad and harmful. She should get some help.
Thank you, I know my OHIP Is up to date as I have my health card in my wallet and I updated it myself when we moved 
You will love Happy People! Perfect to watch when you're snowed/iced in.
Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears.
That's what you get for not washing your mouth for months.
wouldnt like most of the pokemon fanbase be adults now tho
It's fairly good
Agreed, but it took me a while to understand that.
Free market healthcare. Check out what countries like Denmark can achieve in healthcare through taxation. Must be communist propaganda.
Thanks dude, palms were very sweaty lol
I use to work in an office near a 24hr McDonald's. The smell of the place when walking by at 7am was stomach churning.
"I will donate money to the ""Buy a striker fund"" [NAME] up top is beyond frustrating. "
I'm glad you managed to find your own fun and most probably made a big contribution for this great ending. The whole masked rogue idea was amazing
Omg yes. Could you imagine? Pepperoni rolls, peach schnapps in a mason jar and beer cheese at dinner parties. Love it
[NAME] made that lmao
Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. 
Another great bit on identity politics...
Oh ok sorry
My man!
Made me laugh, tbh.
I'm so glad not to have Publix in my region when I see this bullshit...even though *I* miss their subs too... Lol
I've been trying to as well, but the game is so scary :/
‚ô´ Your love for me Won't be quite the same When you take a whiff Of my hershey stains. ‚ô´
You must be really slow. Life must be hard for you. You have my pity.
TSM would be cool
That's just sad and depressing. Was the race closing before she finished? Well, at least she did it.
Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot.
Typical humans, diminishing dog's accomplishments. 
This is very helpful, I'll dive into these links thanks
[NAME] plays well in Texas. So there is that.
That's gonna be a no from me dawg
No Deal has a decent chance of leading to Scotland and NI leaving and thus the end of the United Kingdom
FOOD POISONING BAD BURRITO
They are super super awkward.
I suppose the circumstances of it would chance things a bit :p
> I can't see a teenage girl naming her only son the same name that her baby daddy's actual wife's trueborn son is. /r/brandnewsentence
Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
Yeah, but geology doesn‚Äôt provide enough pumped hydro. Not enough places to do it.
I was considering making a post with the same sort of thing. Good luck with the hunt!
shouldnt be driving baked anyways. even if you think you can, gives us stoners a bad rap
What in the hell are you talking about? I've never said that
I agree she‚Äôs not fat, but that is Photoshopped and posed into oblivion.
I did the same thing in school. Thank [NAME] for the library. Are you anxious about how your brother and sister would react to that?
So birds and limes are bikes. Wow, TIL. 
Thanks <3
The only reason people are there is because they dont know [NAME] is fired lmao.
Honestly, it's a great sample of the world as a whole. One articulate person can steer an entire crowd of idiots to do anything.
"How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
This is disturbing.
I haven't seen such an unpopular hire since [NAME].
Me too üíï
Excuse me who the hell is that?
Wish i had more up votes for you.
Well, if that's how you always are, I can't imagine even wanting to be next you let alone have deer like sex with you.
Sorry *ss Crabtree is there so it's a possibility.
That‚Äôs not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that‚Äôs a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply.
I wish this was because he was being demoted and we were getting a new DC
I use to get this but now I just get ghosted.
I see this guy all the time. It has a great vanity plate to boot.
if it wasn't him it would be someone else she's wasting her life on
Don't worry, I forgive you.
You‚Äôre better off going to University
This bit was more fun than it should have been.
The fact that this hasn‚Äôt happened to [NAME] yet in this day and age is simply incredible.
Then they're the worst fascists of all time, because their critics have been extremely loud and public, while not being murdered.
I didn‚Äôt even realize it says it right there. Sorry
Thank you so much for the help üòä
I didn't know about this, thanks! Just signed up.
"I love this one too ""I like to be spoiled and will spoil my man as well"" Men translate this into ""Pay me for sex"""
Block me,report me, do what you gotta do, you don't own reddit.
LOL SO RANDOM
[NAME] as Manly's top try scorer is pathetically bad.
Do NOT disrespect [NAME]. He is a beautiful, good man!. [NAME] is far from it and not near as pretty.
Ah okay, I'm sorry lol, I'm dumb. Thanks for your response.
Continue the positivity!
> You don‚Äôt get to whitewash Libertarianism‚Äôs racist roots. Please educate me on this or educate yourself:
There's not enough salt in the world for her!
Sounds like you might need some time out in the re-education camp. You are getting frighteningly close to realizing that our system is designed to keep you imprisoned.
Honestly, I really liked being 32. The 30s in general have been great. Happy birthday!
Many people from 2004 played Fortnite too. You know, because it's a good game and not everyone likes to hate on things arbitrarily.
That was the same sunset! Very cool, thanks for sharing.
Yeah, clear off. And tell your mates you had a horrible time too. 
I will mate. No worries.
Jokes on you I have one of those fancy electric toothbrush stands!
Im having a lot of fun, please continue the show
doesn‚Äôt mean you could assume you committed a crime
Nah halfway in the fight your shots were definitely not registering at all on him.. lol
True but he prob loves football more and def enjoys playing football over baseball
damnit i've been enjoying the mutual pisstaking with my Swedish mate
I can't tell if you're serious.
I like [NAME] better
._. yeah, the man is doing something wrong if we feel nothing.
Dear lord this woman is awful
Should be coming this year with MW4. It's now or never
Eh for the right money you cant go wrong letting the kid earn it
I wish to find my best one.
I am female. If someone approached me in a coffee shop who followed your above rules, I‚Äôd be giving out my number for sure.
Possibly. I just couldn‚Äôt go any further with it. Not after that.
Danggit. Im mad i didn't think of that
thanks! That helps
I am not saying that I think many of the latest disputes my husband and i have had ours for a little while longer.
Hit my head on a bench doing parkour. Looked like that lol
Good luck [NAME]
Wha? I'd love more background on this.
Don‚Äôt be ashamed of what you like. You have a good day, fellow redditor. 
Thanks for defending your tribe.
"Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
Oh jeez I missed that :(
It is hard [NAME] damn work, making something this pretty look like a chump!
Luckily he is not.
Tbh as creepy as this post is I was way more sexually active back when I was 16-20 than I am today Kids are horny üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Idk
Suck my good behaviour!
good luck getting them to understand that
[NAME], they deserve each other, but I don‚Äôt want this to happen because they would inevitably procreate and make stupid ‚Äúboring‚Äù kids. 
I miss their 100 Octane petrol...
Thanks for your kind words, I really appreciate it and I hope you're right.
This is racist
There is so much I want to say. Keep [NAME] close. Don't judge others. Work in love. Take love there and bring love back.
I hope he‚Äôs a hit for the contract he got. Looking forward to seeing him.
love seeing his kids too more [NAME] and [NAME] pls!!!
Mug that fool
My bad sorry, what I meant to say is ‚Äòfor our winning season‚Äô not ‚Äòin our‚Äô.
"I'm going to use ""my dicky has to perpetually get sticky"" as a line to pick up ladies. Wish me luck, guys!"
Then just tell him to stop it if you don't like it.
I would tell her part of loving herself/her body is taking care of herself. Speaking as a recovering obese person myself.
I LOVE google voice! IT's the only way I can get my parents to reply to anything!
Lol what an edgelord
My husband died outside the church Damn Vampires
Nope nope nope
Funny how [NAME] only lies when you want him too,amazing.
The BrokenMachine has one of these videos but I'm definitely going to watch yours. Thank you for taking the time to do this.
So edgy.
Haha I've never seen a BritSovcit video but now I'm gonna have to check some out
And yet he's still plummeting in popularity, even now. No he aint babe.
If that‚Äôs true, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree, term limits are a bandaid on an open chest wound. 
I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
Sounds like you are dealing with some difficult mental health issues. Parents generally love their children. maybe try to talk to them??
> its exactly the opposite of what I do to get a girl in the mood This is super creepy
That looks disgusting.
It‚Äôs my birthday too! I‚Äôve always love it!
RNG gear is a solid no from me.
normal looking guys thinking about the weekend, while ugly guys thinking about tongue position, mewing, and item #45 on todays Self Improvement checklist. lmao
This is not a good formation. We‚Äôve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
The arch is so cool. I love St Louis
:) thanks on behalf of kiwi. He‚Äôs quite handsome.
The amount of times this happened during the first tides of war event, smh.
Expect a bunch of bugs as a reward.
That one is pretty obvious
Missing this roster üò¢üò¢üò¢
That would be terrible. I liked the way private Practice ended (more or less) so hopefully [NAME] doesn‚Äôt go for something cliche.
You're welcome! And whoops, my bad. I did not know that, thank you. I edited it up above.
bargaining chip for what? The 25% tariff increase is not big enough of a bargaining chip? lol
Great place and they're super sweet. Happy to support them.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more with you. Thanks for this post!
I had a fleeting thought that he sent a letter to Penthouse Fourms...lol!
Good. Stay the fuck away.
This sucks so much and I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you recover and have a wonderful life.
She's a moron for running out in traffic. Deserved all she got.
Right? If I worked 75 hour weeks I'd want more than a damn gift card to a coffee shop
This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it‚Äôs also the most real he could ever be üòÇ
Lol no.
Holy shit they fornicate like rabbits!!
Ah I love IDLES! Both their albums are absolutely amazing. [NAME], [NAME], and Well Done are some of my favs
WHAT THE FUCK
You smug fuck
why would you have kids? why would you chose not to be with that girl with big boobs? you dumped her?!
Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.
We‚Äôre honestly not doing that bad besides [NAME]. Clear pen, unlucky. Let‚Äôs hope for the best in the second half
Seeing something like this without the usual ‚ÄúWii music‚Äù is so... odd
Thank you for sharing your perspective, and talent.
For real I thought that shit was on loop lol
The drop is the best part of the rollercoaster! :)
If he's still blaming [NAME] for his issues, the therapist is doing a bad job.
I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.
Ah. Not on either of those. [NAME]! ::goes back to stalking profiles::
I feel a tad lost without it now that my drive for football has vanished and basketball and hockey simmer one. The show's every night after all.
Why the fuck do people have these conversations in public
It‚Äôs insane how [NAME] hasn‚Äôt been carded yet
Wouldn't it just be enough to be really interesting is to go through the arguments. However, I would guess this is the most symmetric of these.
If you love the mountains, you should really check it out. The valley can get pretty smoggish in the winter, but usually it's beautiful.
I'm too late to rub this into all the casual's faces. :(
I feel so guilty that this picture exists. I feel like I need to donate to charity after this.
That extraterrestrial little grey creatures don‚Äôt exist? That‚Äôs definitely a fact but I‚Äôm very open to any evidence/proof of the contrary lmao.
Thanks for that. Never really investigated mechanism of it. Seems to be familial as father has it too. Otherwise normal.
Man I remember playing street hockey at desert breeze growing up, good times
Okay thats cool I was asking because I didn‚Äôt know y‚Äôall better stop downvoting me
I love pasta and sushi more than anything! :)
Good for you!
"If that's a euphemism for ""emotional thinking"" then I agree with you"
I really felt for this mother. You could tell how frustrated and exasperated she was. Glad she was there to stand up for her kids.
Season 2 just started and as a huge TNG fan I can definitely say the first season is the closest I've ever seen to another season of TNG
What you fiend!!!!! But seriously, how do these guys feel about animals fucking then?
How dare u/Reijka92 disrespect [NAME] like that!
That‚Äôs gonna be a no from me, [NAME]!
Why hasn't he been made GM yet???
This should be everyone's wish.
Shit he gets too close to a girl and she's liable to hit him with roach spray.
In hindsight, yeah, but we had a healthy [NAME] at that point.
Especially because [NAME] best piece of comedy on the whole show was her impersonation of Shangela's [NAME].
The molcajete is my favorite type of Mexican food. I'm not with you on this one.
Nope. This guy is legitimately this dumb.
Yes, clearly u/backwoodmenace was repeating misinformation intentionally.
I love artic blitz personally
The thought that the armed forces of the US unironically use it is hilarious.
I hate from the bottom of my heart, when animals behave like this..
Because they don‚Äôt want to pay for [NAME]
I will pay to watch a garbage commercial if [NAME] in it, I don‚Äôt even care. He‚Äôs way too fine.
Thank you, LimbRetrieval-Bot! 
The forgotten [NAME]? He's pretty good on the Flash as [NAME].
I want it!
If you are not going to kick him out, then don't complain. It is all your choice
The soft glam palette from ABH, because almost everyone loves it. And I love it too. I am actually loving it more than my modern renaissance üòä
Don't fucking disrespect the World's Largest Love Machine ever again
Aww yesss assalamu ‚Äòalaykum akhi i love when i see a reflective post by you in here
Okay, thanks for the clarification!
In my day I had to wait 20 minutes for the internet to load a single porn pic. But man I miss that dial up sound
That would be awesome
I didn't knew people can be so bad until I met a few people online.
Yessss thats it ...thanks
So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today.
Man, [NAME]. What a shame that trainwreck turned out to be. 
Maybe I‚Äôm an outlier, but I don‚Äôt find that contract to be outrageous for what the player is worth.
I'm pretty sure [NAME] was just joking. Not really sad cringe.
I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth. 
> I feel the big man deserves some love. Because people on places like /r/pcmasterrace doesn't treat him like the second coming of [NAME].
That goes both ways, their adrenaline and determination would also be through the fucking roof.
My DVR did the same thing as yours Damn them.
i think its cool because its a hybrid that comes in stickshift
No I made the best of it, we had so much fun. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! 
aha American Sniper, movie genuinely moved me.
I'm hoping that the TTK might help. He's really bad at R6 for the most part.
There are [NAME] fans on this subreddit. Awesome
What the hell kind of useless annoying bot is this? Beep boop off to hell bot
Ok, then what the actual fuck is your plan?
I am hopeful that it will win the Oscar for best animated picture and renewed interest will lead to more 3D screenings.
I'm tired i'm wasted I LOVE YOU DARLING.
Hey. Maybe talking can help you last till then. What's bothering you?
Yes,on top of that feel like vomitting,can't breathe and thinking I will faint.
Unfortunately there are also far less/weaker unions now too
HOW DARE ANYBODY CRITICIZE YOUR POST IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR POST HISTORY! RECOGNIZE HIS PRIVILEGE PEOPLE!!
So glad I moved here.
The rich are horrible, horrible people..... and yet we keep voting GOP to give them more tax breaks, the hell is wrong with us?
I don‚Äôt think his clothing was so tight when he purchased it..
Banner price is down to 100k donuts. And I still don't have enough..... (sad face)
I'm excited for them, but I can understand why anyone wouldn't be. They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game
Thank you for telling me !
Not true for a lot of people but [NAME]
Tfw when not only is it tiny, but it‚Äôs damn ugly too. :( 
Shut up [NAME]
That‚Äôs strange logic that it triggered you.. they will use any retarded attempt to hoover you he probably hoped you would notice and get triggered by it.
Because teams do dumb things when they‚Äôre desperate.
Cordovan in the mech with the loudspeaker really makes me smile. It is just so bonkers. I love it.
America v Necaxa Was postponed till March. America doesn't play until next Jornada 2
Love me some Clash
Mob mentality makes it worse. Four man SWF groups are generally, by far, the most toxic people in the game. 
Man, I remember when we were utter pish. Those were not happy memories.
This dog is so cute
In the short term, yes. 
Haha exactly right!!
as someone who is a big save the earth guy this is truly awesome and makes me proud to be a fan of the yankees
That was brutal.
I wish to join you on the search, as a source of motivation and friendship (sorry if that kinds led you on)
This is the single dumbest defense out there for aim assist. This shit is just retarded.
You contradicted yourself
[NAME] is worse because he‚Äôs all of those things plus he took out my boi [NAME].
I take Yaz to treat PMDD and it has minimal side effects for me: no acne, no weight gain, no babies. I hope this helps!
But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about
I can't even imagine the stupid tattoo I'd have if I got one at 15. Probably like a Red Bull logo or something
So it isn‚Äôt pretty much the same? Glad you think I‚Äôm right then.
I hope you enjoy it!
Welcome to non union states!
This is the best thing I've ever seen on Reddit
The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
That solves it. Thank you!
That's a succinct explanation thanks!
And maybe one day you'll be able to afford one, but until then continue being an edgy teenager whining about the war on drugs. 
No that was my cyst that got removed today lol
Just cleaned my room
I actually enjoy watching this while eating
Our country is in no way, shape or form ready for the risk of a giant inflation wave.
What a disgusting pair of human beings, if you can even call them that
If there's evidence besides say-so, chances are better.
The EPA allowed DuPont to use a chemical that literally kills people in their nonstick pans. They can be bought too unfortunately.
we got good at breakaways!!
If we backed a second referendum and the Lib Dems were at 10% I'd be pretty annoyed to be honest. Cheeky sods.
Thanks! I like your advice. I'm a mom too. I was even smaller after she was born than before my pregnancy. Weirdness.
haha I'm guessing she doesn't spark joy for you, so you can let her go 
I thought it was like a fake url sorry
‚ÄúFall in love with at least one physical, one artistic, and one intellectual pursuit‚Äù ‚Äî This is great advice! Thank you üòä
[NAME] dude I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
Shit, they don‚Äôt go down!? That blows 
Bidets are disgusting. In america, we use toilet paper because our plumbing systems can take it
This is a reliable estimate. It could happen as early as in the 2020‚Äôs if were unlucky
Best person available on DL or OL, CB if the two positions mentioned do not justify the pick. Trade back if we miss on all 3. 
I really love this title.
Well in that case you should just tell other people I guess. And welcome to Reddit.
No, but you wouldn't believe what I'm not tired of seeing...
Enjoying it. It makes shaving my head easier.
I enjoyed this TED talk.

You‚Äôre braver than me, thank you for your service O7

I‚Äôve seen him on the facebook page! Thank you!
"""PPG Paints"" arena or whatever it's called now is worse"

The Chargers defense looks impossibly bad

Honestly I can't see why not. Tho I'm a bi male so I don't know if it's valid haha
Sew up that cockholster son, no one gives a fuck.
"My work days are usually similar....but even the ""good morning"" is hard for me to initiate some mornings. I feel your pain!"
Now THAT'S a victory royale :)
I miss my Shrek Ghrok :(
Since [NAME] are technically [NAME].
To make money from money is disgusting and is screwing up the economy.
Your right thanks
How exciting.
Congratulations on your appointment to such a prominent position! I was a huge fan of Utah when I went, the canyons are sick. GO KNIGHTS GO 
Hopefully they won't try to blame the trucker.
My wife with BPD hasn't even kissed me in over a year. Get used to it if you're sticking around.
Lmao I‚Äôm so sorry but yet intrigued as to how it contributed to your breakup?
Gas Crisis. It‚Äôs the best episode of all time.
Wow, that sounds like it could be great.
Thanks, now I can get back to the actual content
My kids did, I‚Äôm sure! I hope this card enjoys the bottom of my trash can. 
Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.
And that wig is awful
The only thing that stops a bad toddlers with a gun is a good toddler with a gun.
yeah, thanks
But once it's born, if its parents can't afford food, shelter and medical care, it can go fuck itself.
It‚Äôs horrible for me, way worse than your situation. Be Glad that you aren‚Äôt me
Fine as long as the experience is not frustrating. Problem is not balance problem is it‚Äôs not fun
People working in hospitals are seriously under appreciated.
Pig Latin kills me internally this is why plastic surgery exsists.
I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole.
I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.
Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
Inland Empire must be objectively the worst film ever then.
I hated doing group work. Unless groups were assigned I always went by myself.
Looks like she admires [NAME]. Its just drag.
I'm personally curious why we didnt get a video bit from him. Is he natty or bust? His stuff is great
Can relate. The spirit kept telling me to move to the Morridor. Total decade+ long disaster in almost every way. Shoulda stayed where I was.
toy has lost its value
Yeah, Inbox didn't have those so I forgot all about it until they killed it.
That doesn‚Äôt help people in market though.
It can't be, I won't believe it.......this is some antivawers bulls**t xD

We smart apes

bro if you can't hold your pee for 30 min, you should go see a doctor
Scared? A little bit. It's more of a simmering disgust at this point for myself.
Some folks are just bitter and taking it out on the world right now. Don't give into their idocy, keep up the good spirit!
Bitch yes!
My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her.
Sounds like you need to get some help /s
I‚Äôd love for [NAME] to turn into prime [NAME]
Wait, did this really happen? I'd like to see that video so I can cringe some more plz.
Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
[NAME] has stated that he's open to decriminalization. It's up to the legislature at this point.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
He is such a cutie, I had no idea he was polish 
Normally yeah but that was my friends first match ever and to encounter such a killer, who was running noed too is kinda disheartening for him
Showering with someone feels more intimate than sex for me...and I don't like it.
I miss you [NAME] üò¢üò≠
I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
I'm doing a lot better. It means a lot that you checked in on me. Thank you!
My whole life‚Äôs been a lie
another one of those chicks sacrificing her children for a man and 'happiness'
Definitely. I find if I don't exercise for a few weeks I'll gain a few pounds quick..
The douche is strong with this one.
No that's stupid
Never. I miss the opportunity of leaving earlier than I did. That‚Äôs about it.
Create new holidays. We need a Ralsei day where we celebrate fluffy bois.
The guy with the camo comment is correct. r/woosh
Well I am happy you believe that.
Beautiful and thank you for the inspiration.
[NAME] campaign donation at work apparently. Sure didn't take long.
I love how nobody posting here to decry the buzzfeed article is using their actual accounts, they‚Äôre all throwaways. Cowards. Just like your felonious President.
I absolutely think this is possible, and for the good of our team: *TOLES FINDS DEM HOLES!*
My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that
Happy for you!
My god. I'd place that upside-down on the table and walk.
Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life...
she seem immature, playing mind games. I would be direct and if she still keeps playing games let her go. seems like an attention seeker.
[NAME], someone get her a green card so she can clean rooms at the Super 8 and stop obsessing on social media. 
I am so sorry for your loss and all the stress you have right now. All the internet hugs you want right now! <3
AMAZING!! I can‚Äôt wait for your talking head!
Careful, he's a hero
don't worry, the funding will arrive the year after!
You fruitcart, you oughta be ashamed of knowing that, let alone expecting anyone else to know.
I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
I doubt that [NAME] cares.
Fuck
That‚Äôs awesome! Hopefully the sanity keeps up
You have more patience than I do.
Exactly, I remember loving those videos but I was also like 12
Mine is when my husband says our daughter‚Äôs emphysema is acting up. No, husband. Her eczema is. 
Thanks [NAME], very cool.
I'm sensitive! :'(
Gang beast is really only fun with friends
Love anytime we can work [NAME] into a conversation.
Yeah [NAME] has won worlds
I didn‚Äôt like that blue & yellow until you said [NAME].
That's not what diffusion is at all smh
5 is absolutely average. 6 would be kinda cute but nothing special. Kinda annoys me that so many people rate 5 as being lowkey ugly lol
Sorry, an errant surge of frustration 
Ah, I work 9-5 :( but I appreciate the invite!
What? No deal, abort, abort!
[NAME]! Big fan of your graphic novels!
This is damn sick. Has almost a vapor wave feel lol.
This is r/tifu. If you're not caught jacking it into the turkey, you're doing it wrong. 
The Dude looks great. I always get worried when I see [NAME] play these haggard characters. But he's just that good.
How about dumb trolls like you who only repeat your own stupid narratives and word-bending 24 hours a day
Compelling argument, in line with expectation
You want forgiveness? Stop spamming.
I GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
That game was great. THOT, be gone...
No room. Get lost. I cc u!
Calm down.
Lol, what?
This is why I worry about you sometimes
SHE MAKES ME CRINGE :(
> I think [NAME] is the best QB Prospect since Luck üòê
Having read the entire article, and some of the other FAQ, the only thing this is telling is that [NAME] read the same book very differently.
I'm ordained. When's the wedding? üôã This is a terrible idea. I don't know what I'm doing.
Great. Then he can levy a fine against person who took the photo.
Hope he's ok, the game needs more people with names like [NAME]
Couldn't agree more
I love these blobs, would have done the same thing
Orange fan sad. :(
U get an updoot from one sad person to another
I like [NAME] suit less the more I see it in action.
You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.
I'm 34 and disappointing my mother is still my greatest fear.
Dude don‚Äôt even trip. [NAME] is the shit. I also have a soft spot for [NAME] if you‚Äôre into her at all lol
thanks, i didn‚Äùt think of it that way but i guess it‚Äùs true
My bf uses profanity, and I don't care. There's no reason for misogyny though.
This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.
Saw that on Scrubs, love that show.
I feel awful posting it, but I couldn‚Äôt not share :|
I'm sorry, but that poor kitty looks miserable.
I adore Brutus and Pixie!!
me. i‚Äôm the problem. i don‚Äôt think anyone can help me anymore.
I feel personally attacked.
Thanks I got sorted here anyway.
Whatever you do, respect the kids' genders.
Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles
> No one likes being made to vote more often than they have to. My love of the sausage sizzle says otherwise!
His eyebrows are too precious
I was rooting for the saints. There‚Äôs no way in hell the rams will beat the patriots
My family never cared enough, I wish they did...
Nice, but everyone deserves the best.
The only way this is OK is if their kid made it for them. But then you feel bad for the kid. Lose lose..
I remember being three years old and feeling mortified and frustrated that my preschool teacher and classmates were freely dancing to ridiculous music.
This is his worst season since his rookie year
I‚Äôm so jealous
I still rock my Casey Hampton pro bowl jersey!!
I really liked this but holy shit I miss my AR shots compared to like 1440 or even 1600
You guys are heading toward healing, that's amazing.. Is it possible that you are wishes on true healing 
This is my favourite movie. Not enough can be said for [NAME] acting. One of the best things about it.
This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
I know, I know. I wish Reptile had a better fate. 
I did that, I asked for a white doctor and they gave me a list of black doctors.
Will come back rich and driving his goddamn Bentley
Try some other banks, maybe smaller ones, and good luck! Maybe get that deposit up a bit more, and borrow less.
I‚Äôm that skinny and have so much trouble gaining weight

"Three words, no subtlety. ""Dude. Stop. Seriously."" "
To be fair he probably is saying that.
It‚Äôs really 90%, which is what the customer is told. Corporate isn‚Äôt real smart when it comes to signage. 
All is well! Think I got one sorted out with one of her family members. Thanks for your help!
You‚Äôre an asshole.
Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
Definitely valid in my case. But let's remember our friends who have had or are currently having a rough time when it comes to family life, as well.
Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer u/justforyouthlogic
I‚Äôm not listening to a fucking plant.
No Mayo No Care.
I didn‚Äôt realize! I‚Äôm pretty new here. Should I check the website?
Thanks man, hope the holidays were good to you and yours. 
How is this the epitome of slavery? Nobody is forcing you to do this. Stop being dramatic.
[NAME] has turned into one of the NBA's great actors
I won't stop crying üò≠
I think those red hats increase their IQ by -1
I feel fantastic
I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot.
Nah we love telling people to post hog, you're just making our day better.
I might be able to help. A/S/L?
Ya see I‚Äôm an engineer that means I solve practical problems.
Dutch bros made this a legit drink. It‚Äôs their cold brew steamed I believe. Edit: spelling
I am so so happy for you. <3
Yep, they‚Äôre women‚Äôs shoes!!
Great idea! :) I'd be happy to give her a good reference!
Why tho... I don't understand why I like this so much
DON'T DO THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES LIKE THAT THEY DON'T WANT HER EITHER BRUH
Thanks [NAME].
Which is odd, he was terrible on Sunday
When I looked at the picture, I thought for a moment that I was looking at a junk yard.
Are 3.0 still active? I was really hoping they would have gotten signed after their tryout camp a couple years back.
How disgusting. Those vile people can burn in hell!
Become proficient with firearms and learn a second language if your in the us I'd suggest spanish
I'm sorry, no. The hostess was 15. I was 24. At the steakhouse, only hostess girls answered phones.
Have a good day at work bud
Oh lord that's nasty. Guess I'm getting some fried chicken tonight.
If only someone would love the septuple-PhD in the galaxy for her mind.lol
Wasn‚Äôt there a video of the exact same dude kicking down a fucking tree????
Oh god dammit I've been bamboozled, I fell for the b8
just fed up of reading subjective opinions be paraded as fact that he was the worse ever.
Science has its role in a society. It should serve that role. It should not try to usurp morality, spirituality etc.
Yes! I used to do this all the time actually, especially go to the mall alone. It was actually really nice.
I honestly can‚Äôt keep a secret but I think that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a Chatty [NAME], not because of my gender. 
Correct What the fuck is the AAF is what im asking.
Aww thanks :)
I must go, my people need me
Incredible work and very unique, good for you
Best description of online dating ever
I will tell my NP he may have inspired pancakes in someone's future :)
Ah, the movies are fine. It's pretending they're a profoundly trascendental form of art that I find ludicrously funny.
I hope that's all it is. Didn't see him take a hit or anything.
>Teamates lap ruin Omg nothing makes me so angry same as running towards the hook or gen with the killer behind. Run somewhere else!
This was good. I‚Äôm not the OP, but thanks for posting.
YOU STOLE MY GODDAMN COMMENT! <3
You had a tough childhood :(
No,not a fan of cigarettes
It wouldnt. Legalization would drive consumers towards legal vendors.
Ha at least you‚Äôre in on the joke.
Love it. Be well [NAME]
Pretty sure that had been upped to at least 10k subs. It actually might even be higher now.
I like the pig because shes stealthy
My mom likes to use the word, ‚Äútripolar‚Äù for me and it‚Äôs aggravating. 
What in the bipolar hell is going on? Yikes
"""Stay in your lane, bro."""
Yes, listening to loud noises can damage your ears. Temporarily and permanently.
Trying to read that made me feel like I just huffed formaldehyde amd mercury
Agreed. How do you feel about the rumors that he doesn't pick any girl as an endgame?
This is one of my favorite threads ever.
I don't know why but every time I see a meme telling me how good I am it doesn't do anything and doesn't make me happy
San Diego is fucking awesome! This is coming from someone who lives in arguably the best place to live in Canada
Oh man. Hardest lesson for me to learn as a new dm was that even with experienced players, combat with 7 PCs is brutally time consuming 
She refuses them by inhaling them [I'm sorry if that sounded bad plz no downvite]
I don't swallow toothpaste idiot
It is really boring. There is a culture in church, but it is essentially soulless and is really only weirdness with a heaping of superiority complex.
I love those moments
I could never deface my car like that omg
This hurts to watch
I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
What a legend.
"No, it was believed that the baby absorbed maternal traits because the mother was the ""soil"" the ""seed"" grew in. "
That's pretty funny imo
*me trying to get it* OH!!!!!!!!!!
I did the Karl's Corner VIP package and it was great. There was a mini Weezer museum and I met [NAME]! And saw [NAME] from afar.
This is horrible
I wish I could be you. Our thing is dragging on forever and I‚Äôm heartbroken af.
I love hearing other peoples stories about being high as hell watching drag race or being high on this sub. Y'all are my people.
I was fine until I got to the ICU.
That gives you zero right or say over what someone wears. You are wrong.
Such an ignorant comment, his reasoning is public information and is right
Nah, you‚Äôre totally one of those MAGAmers. Your comments could‚Äôve come straight out of the subreddit.
That's how I apologize to carists, too
Thank you much! At least it's just hair, it'll be back
Yes, I do. I'm open to dating from anywhere- friends of friends, nights out, online. 
The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
He lost his shoes. He‚Äôs legally dead.
I sleep alone on the floor. That was a bad idea...
Spoiler alert, it's terrifying and depressiong
Great post - much appreciated. Gave me some good points to ponder.
I think they're doing it so they can ignore the fact that [NAME] served [NAME] to champions at the White House lol
my little abomination
Sadly, it looks like there are a ton of [NAME] in this sub
No, it makes it better.
It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
That‚Äôs the most badass joke I‚Äôve heard
Good luck!
I want to die
I mean all marxist obviously praise [NAME], and would hold meetings with [NAME].
it's a damn shame.
I can‚Äôt wait to try the cleric class again!
It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance.
I actually feel assaulted by this video.
Glad to hear it has kept going strong. And employed your dad for that long.
Oh got it
Oh no the poor man
Let me translate: No. Find them yourself. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them think. But thank you for describing yourself.
> lack of diversity in the cast now that's a new one lmao
> In some, cops fire blanks in the hall to simulate an active shooter scenario. That's incredibly stupid, and serves no purpose.
Saved this. Not OP but I feel like you just threw me a life jacket. Thank you.
Oh, well, you again I tried some stuff, people ignore me anyway
Gonna have to say no on the last sentence lol
I mean some of that is probably true. What a weird situation.
"""These people didn't go to my church therefore they are demonic"""
I‚Äôm sorry men, I have failed you. My rigidity was no match for the flaccid effort our boys showed tonight
I'm sorry you're going through that, I wish I could help somehow :c.
So she goes to her little boy instead of doctor, I hope?...
I buy and sell iPhones and January has been slow for me too. Good luck to all of us.
Good job, white truck! Don't use the damn shoulder to pass!
I‚Äôve thought about journaling. I think I‚Äôll give that a try sometime soon. Thank you for your words my friend
I'm the same. I prefer sad depressed dudes and idk why. I know I like taking care of people though..
I wish the double down would leave *me* out of this! My poor stomach. Once was enough.
Nice play! But, why would u play [NAME], in tribute?
I think this divorce is planned so that people will stop pointing fingers at the insane rich person robbing the wealth of the people.
Anywhere skytrain wants to expand my tax paying dollars will be ok with it.
Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again
I can't help it when everyone just loves us ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I prefer men under 5‚Äô10 but I‚Äôve never heard anyone piss and moan or call *that* discrimination.
Man at this point I'd be happy with just a few non-sweeps.
Yep, just PC this time, sorry
I love how happy he looks while listening to tool.
That‚Äôs what I thought. With 4 out of the 9 still on the show, I just can‚Äôt call it accurate at all.
Laws don‚Äôt apply when you‚Äôve got money. Sad but true.
Yeah you're right, I mistyped it. Should have said after 1st and after the 2nd. There's none after the 3rd.
This aged poorly
Yeah, it‚Äôs interesting how I‚Äôve had conversations on the overground but not the underground. 
Don't worry, he's getting Karma.
I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.
Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be
Aye the party left me. Now I'm stuck in with this old boys tadger staring me in the face.
He can't rescind. What a dumbass
That's an interesting way to do it. I might come off as a little crazy, but this would definitely be an interesting experiment. 
can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(
"Read it again. Your response shows you didn't understand what I said. ""YES"" = yes you need a degree."
This converstaion reminds me of this old [NAME] cartoon. Apparently some people were upset by it.
[NAME]. I just want you to have a great stat day.
She was walking like that shoe was up her butt at the club. So tacky and just nah.
Same here. It‚Äôs very hard. I really feel for you.
Love the song! First one I‚Äôve bought in a long time
Also, they ruined Top Gear but that‚Äôs a whole other issue.
The saddest thing is you will never understand how absolutely idiotic what you just said is.
that's awesome!
Not cool Op...not cool...
I can only imagine the mud butt that comes with a bowl of DQ chicken and DUMPlings
This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
It‚Äôs a substitute teacher. She should know to stay in her lane.
I'm very sorry for u, they should treat you like royalty not a fleshlight
A news source putting out sponsored news is inappropriate. Stop reading BBC i guess
Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible.
Short answer, you can‚Äôt. Your making that sacrifice
She threatened to hurt you, I would file a police report.
Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from üòÇüòÇ
I am trying so hard right now! LOL!
it's ok to need an equal partner
None of the [NAME] said please or thank you to the waitress
"But terrible people is my ""type"""
I hope this season [NAME] wins everything:
> So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns.
I enjoyed [NAME] intermission report where he was very low energy until the end when he squeaked out a HI MOM =D because he's the best
very psychiatric of you nul points from me but the whole of reddit will be proud!
I'm too stupid to understand what you're saying
I believe if under 6 months you'll get it all back in the end.
sorry should clarify ... have dinner / drinks and then go our separate ways to other events that night.
This is the technically correct answer, but it still sucks considering how much of society rides on women managing their menstrual cycles.
Hi, [NAME]! I am stopping by to wish you the best day, and the best year! -HappyFriendlyBot
>Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. 
Ahhh, I see. I thought you were saying they made you afraid of the sessions.
You're gullible enough to believe them.
WYA? I'll come through.
That‚Äôs what they said when the provincial election for Ontario happened too Then [NAME] begged on tv, that low life. Good luck! 
Oh true I remember seeing it on Spotify‚Äôs charts for weeks. It‚Äôs terrible.
I love this!! And it‚Äôs so true
You conveniently ignored my response to this naivety when you said it before.
Agree! Poor girls! They seem so sweet.
SWTOR is horrible when you want to play together with someone. So many parts that you can't join in on.
yes, very sexist
This is disgusting.
Does anyone here think this will actually turn the Jet's around? I feel like this is the worst shit ever.
im sure it's a real slap in the face
Well that was disheartening.
I pray that you will have strenght to fight for yourself and go NC.
I'm more annoyed at the Labour MPs that didn't vote for it - I expect more from them
Sounds like how I brought in the new year. 3 arguments and counting.... thank [NAME] there is work tomorrow
The SNP were, I remember [NAME] stridulating about it at conference, but I don‚Äôt think it was a go-er.
Why everyone mad i think it was a joke .people these days over sensitive my [NAME].
God damn I miss this game!
Let‚Äôs get greedy and take back what is rightfully ours
Just because you stopped to let me cross doesn't mean the other 3 lanes of cars did.
Damn it, now that he's out of prison he's unqualified to work for the [NAME] administration. 
Apart from the attempted basketball pass he's been great
"[NAME] is like ""Mine! AALLL MINE HAHAHA"""
Great minds more like... And youtube suggestions.
THANK YOU ROY! i was just about to say, how are they just discovering [NAME] being british.
It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent
Seriously! Such an odd way to ask a question about traveling.
Yeah! We should have given him justice by believing in claims with no merit! Yeah. Btw. [NAME] raped me 30 years ago! Get him!
Would need the #1 overall in 2 years... should try to get a first in next years draft for AB and hope that team tanks
They aren't horrible in the least bit. Just learn from your mistake, remember, and move on. That's all you can do.
B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. 
That's the kind of problem a physical therapist is more qualified to handle. Good luck
We need more vowelled insults so you can spell an Acronym with them
It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME]
r/suddenlytrans? This is totally a joke I'd make if I grew
Long hair for guys should happen more, it looks cool *and feels nice too*
No one to blame here, bad luck is what it is.
I love when the subreddit shows [NAME] some love! We have so many people that keep an ear to the ground for quality [NAME] content.
Spice Burger. Delicious!
Im sure shell last 5 min
I hate how much I love these and the Banquet brownies. Only redeeming part.
Oh....yuck
You look so happy now üòç Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ‚ù§Ô∏è
>the ad, which has been both criticised and applauded Applauded by non-customers. Criticized by customers.
I want G League over here in Spokane so bad!
That's called lust, and is completely normal. Just dont get obsessive and do things to keep you busy and dont be afraid of them feelings 
that number 3 is soooo familiar and sad.
Geez those heroes..
>I think this is the same for most people. Exactly.
I've read the series through 4 times. There is literally zero reason to believe that.
Whaaat. I liked Season 8 [NAME]. I wish the whole love arc between him and [NAME] had never been a thing, but I liked [NAME]. 
Well, you stopped coming on CV. Now I am left alone to fend off Agent debaters.
FUCKING NORMIES REEEEEEEEE
Just learn to talk to yourself like [NAME] and you'll only be a little lonely.
Don't ask women for dating advice unless you are a woman. The answers you get will do you no good.
lonzo can be special but teams just aren‚Äôt as patient anymore
Your body, your choice. Sorry it had to mean the end of the relationship. But it's better now rather than later as tensions grow. 
[NAME] is insane! Better knuckle skills than any rider ever. I sure hope he has a speedy recovery from his crushed kneecap!
You can start your life over any time you want. I think the secret is to not let failure keep you from trying again.
Ugh sucker punch
It's interesting, if this was about invasive food smells in an apartment this conversation probably wouldn't be happening.
Feeling bit better now, but the feeling as a whole will come back I know.
Don't call this baby a jerk It just loves its humans too much
I love snow! It means snow days!
1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up
I really want [NAME] out of these two, but I‚Äôm curious who he would tap as OC.
Yeah I could not even do that I could not move my leg to the side
Extremely painful to watch
That is SO cool
I‚Äôm more worried about the dude getting pissed all over my shoes
Fruit is byfar the worst of all flavors
Just be yourself lol. Some girls find awkward/goofy cute ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nobody actually likes tiktok adverts
Goodness, don't say that. But then, if that half is the one that survives I don't want to
And the amount of crops we eat is destroying river systems and forests. Not to mention the animals killed inadvertently during harvest.
I can‚Äôt wait for him to file bankruptcy. His legendary move.
i hate that it's over an interstate bridge so people traveling from the west from other states have to look at it edit* because it's fucking corny
I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
‚Äú270 pound pink person‚Äù is a great alliteration.
Oh no! I'll check into it; there are transcripts available, but it isn't really the same thing, is it? 
lol you are 18 and a female. You'll surely find someone
great weed, terrible vaccination rates.
I got $10 on Anzac Day as the guy won money and 2 x $5 tips that‚Äôs all.
Not this time
LOL men don't have feelings ;)
Definitely, I also get suspicious when someone tries to be my friend which doesn‚Äôt help
Good lord. > STATISTICS ARE BAD, WE MUST RELY ON ANECDOTES!
This whole thing is ridiculous, I love reddit sometimes. ... and I'm sure reddit really loves this ridiculousness too!
I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself.
Ah sorry [NAME], I was going to join. But your desperate posts scared me away!
this looks natty with ideal picture conditions
> a new release is imminent. Hahahaha
I don‚Äôt know about the whole state but we do have some shady cab drivers here.
this. faster, same pedaling but way less effort involved.
Competitive Deathmatch was a huge reaper fest last season :( Had many games where everyone was reaper except maybe two people
asking for a source is good lol
Most GH now is fake. The real stuff is exorbitantly expensive.
I don‚Äôt have to stop speaking fact simply because it‚Äôs uncomfortable for you to hear.
I‚Äôd go back to the 1996 season. That‚Äôs the last time we were in crazy cold territory.
This sub is becoming a ‚ÄúGamers rise up‚Äù parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
Sorry, didn't know where else to put it
This is the only thing I care about from this entire season so far.
I love how defeatist we've all become.
But even then it would need something else to live
Whoops yeah my bad And no just from the pictures ive seen there were just u opened sauce packets arranged on platters
This actually happened but no one clapped
WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo
Man. I can't wait until my life is so devoid of meaning I feel compelled to complain in a silly joke subreddit.
Agreed, rarely get mad at ones like hun or darl. Being called boy by an old man however is infuriating.
I'm sorry. Does Scholomance exist in the World of Ice and Fire?
Sorry to hear that was all it got :/
Oh I can feel the burn all the way from Australia, even a few months later. Doesn't anyone have a direct source to this post? Thanks
Love this show :)
BEHOLD THE GREAT GRAIN [NAME] BECKONS US TO ITS CHAMBER! FOLLOW ME MY FELLOW BIRDS INTO THE ABYSS!
Its distasteful to complain about male-dominated space like stem? **pearl clutching intensifies**
nice looks like I hit just about hit the sweet spot, thanks
My second doc! I‚Äôm a student from Cleveland and would love any tips you guys have.
He's not alt-right. He's just the normal clutch pearling conservative. He's like an annoying villain from an 80s movie.
If liking your own country is a right wing talking point then why don't the left wingers just leave the country?
Absolutely this is the kind of absolute hypocrisy that made me leave the church!
What a useless answer in this situation
If they were that good, she wouldn't have burned through 3 pairs in 3 years. 
These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
"By who? Hate the Flames all you want, but there's nobody competing for a wildcard spot that will ""dunk"" them in the first round"
"i enjoyed this a lot. i especially enjoyed ""Everybody bleeds a little when they brush their teeth """
The kids aren‚Äôt doing anything stupid here... cause it‚Äôs a fake video. I feel like this is in the wrong sub.
Go on a group vacation!! Or a concert weekend that‚Äôd be fun!
Argentina is with you! Be strong comrades!
I agree, not to say he would be a favourite but [NAME] is very hittable, one good headkick is all it takes
Short and simple... More embarrassing being a janitor or being in the unemployment line?
You have to leave the house.
It‚Äôs crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the hurt, this shit sucks so bad.. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone..
Was just in the Grampians over the long weekend. Haven't been there in 20 years. Still love it.
I‚Äôm not sure why I just laughed so hard at this. It‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs funny!
Maybe. It's an interesting theory for sure :)
Totally!! It was such a relief to see that I wasn't the only one (female HL in a DB).
I love this. Kids just live in the moment which makes them so unaware of so many things.
oh, me too, actually.
Chuckled. Upvote!
I‚Äôm picking up my fourth one tomorrow. CZ Scorpion Evo 3 .... and I‚Äôm stoked
It's a disturbing read. Have a good time üòÇ
Precisely this. I don't see why this is such a hard concept for some people to grasp.
This is an incipient antivaxx community, I don't want to see them lobbying and increasing in numbers like in the USA or Romania
Oh... welp. üòë
Thanks I needed that.
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
Must've misunderstood something about his injury. Thanks for pointing it out
Sometimes when it gets super annoying I cut it off with scissors but it always turns out worse and makes all the surrounding ones irritated and sore
Thank you for this very informative answer. I don't play the game but you really explained well why they put this system in place.
You‚Äôre heartless if you‚Äôre calling people who smoke marijuana ‚Äúdruggies‚Äù and I‚Äôm done arguing with you, have a nice day.
That's no excuse.
Don't give yourself so freely to people who don't value you.
Nah, black bears are big scaredy cats Now brown ones on the other hand...
I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. 
OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
I was once married and now I live alone. Some weekends, I don‚Äôt speak to anyone and don‚Äôt go out. Pure heaven. 
Worse than selling your soule
Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
That does help a bit, thanks.
Wow, that's so clever!
Seeing that knife on this subreddit put the fear of [NAME] in me
Mr [NAME] is operater as fuck
You guys are so cute together! Good luck with the de-stressing!
She‚Äôs my girl crush
Anyways. Weird behaviour of it when it was happening is that it hid itself when the video was paused then reappeared as the video continued.
Oh that‚Äôs so sad that she thinks anyone cares about her opinion
Grado SR80e is what I have, $100 and the best headphones I‚Äôve ever put on 
I love how all these suspects greet [NAME] like an old friend.
Thanks man! You rule.
Oh god yes. Top quality cringe. Thank you for sharing
I told my mum and an ambulance is coming now. Thanks everyone
Don't tell yourself those lies. They only serve to keep that weight in place. We're all lucky to have you. You're a gem
Have fun!
Dallas should feel absolutely horrible this is a 1 goal game given how patheticallly bad the Devils are tonight.
Hugs to you It will get better
I'm not looking forward to mine. Need to just do them though. I spent a lot last year on medical bills so hoping the deduction helps.
I love how he bends down with his head in the 'loaded' guillotine to screw off the end cap.
No that's plenty, you've already proved the original comments point even further.
No one does
The nightmares I'm going to have tonight would like to thank you in advance.
Look at all the REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Lol
Missed opportunity to put [NAME]
Ah well I still feel a bit bad for the parrot but at least he won‚Äòt be harmed :)
Ugh, so misleading, and such a disappointment for those of us whose skin is the color of ACTUAL porcelain. 
"She also spoke out quite angrily about ""Obamacare"" until she needed it due to her high risk pregnancy. She's remarkably hypocritical."
180 is not good for checking enzyme deficiency which is what I am referring too.
not really, no
I won't even reply anymore. That radio silence mid convo really gets on my nerves.
Welcome to the depressed group
A track would be much more suitable for this kind of recklessness! Keep this kind of dangerous driving off of public roads!
I hope the guys play 60 minutes tonight! Have a nice day everyone c:
Thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
Good advice right here and good things to think about.
No way would I give up Albies even in a 1 for 1 scenario.
5 years for a guy who will most likely break down physically before year 3. Awesome move.
You are entitled to live your life the way you want to. I never said you weren't. You really are just disappointing.
Ah, I see. Thank you for clarifying!
Yeah he's a real one. I would've loved him coaching the Broncos
Voter fraud is way too easy to pull off, I know from experience 
"Lol thanks, yeah you need to ""legitimize"" the being hacked part and build from there. "
Watching it deteriorate into a horrific dystopia. Healthcare costs. Dental. Low wages.
youve never played against a good support [NAME] then
He posted about white racists on a post that has nothing to do about racism. Pretty sure he is just racist.
Don't cry for me, Argentina.
this is hurting UCF's chance at a super bowl
So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
I think this is a normal human emotion that a lot of people can relate to.
These [NAME] names are really beautiful!!!
I miss when prequel memes was ironic
i actually like adore (maybe I‚Äôm uneducated oof) what has she done?
You said the words I couldn‚Äôt find in my head. That‚Äôs what I was trying to say the whole time! Thank you.
Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I‚Äôm one and it‚Äôs really fun :)
You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
Putting your finger and a loose cloth inside the 3 jaw chuck to polish the inside is insanely dangerous
Damn... that‚Äôs another thing I didn‚Äôt even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn‚Äôt steal food
Fuck this team. I‚Äôm done, we all should boycott this bullshit
He acted like such a jerk- why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I would never trust him again.
That sentence should be illegal.
Yankees, Nets, and Giants, all the best!
Good work, friend. 
From Rockledge, Florida in the united states. Don't know why I ended up here to be honest but it's a good time.
yes. i hate being bored. it's the cause of much of my depression and anxiety.
Gotta eliminate the competition. It's Just Good Business.
that was absolutely beautiful
Well, that‚Äôs not a position many conservatives hold except for the [NAME], but I appreciate the honesty.
Like [NAME] [NAME] yes but [NAME] [NAME] is super nasty. Whoever wrote the dialogue for classified needs to be fired cause it‚Äôs makes me wince
I'm yet to see the 2nd protect the rest of the constitution.
It‚Äôs oddly unsatisfying when someone beats me to saying that.
Your friend is an idiot. You were the embodiment of Be More Kind. [NAME] bless you
No, thankfully. 
Thank you! That‚Äôs good to hear. I like presenting the place as it is.
Full schedules have been The end for us before but This time I have hope
This is so true cause I always think ‚Äúare they just using me for sex?‚Äù
This is infuriating but what‚Äôs also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
Denver will pay for bus fare so homeless people can come live here And we love it! That's where the tents come from!
We're moving from Utah to California later this year. These statistics make me even more excited!!
The likes of [NAME] utter genius cannot be fathomed by mere mortals
Thank you for that statement.
Yeah, still the wrong strain to even remotely dive into CBD therapy (<0.7, yikes)... but I understand your point.
Sorry for the delay. Nanaimo's a union/mill town, so no surprise the NDP won.
You got the kindest heart
It'll be the first game of the day!
Lost his legs, what an idiot.
So many inaccuracies here.....
Absolutely you are doing the right thing. She will not take this decision lightly. So be prepared for the fallout now.
They make money to sit and talk to you there's no reason to feel like a burdon cause it's legit their job.
true I am a troll, but fortunately for me I'm not emotionally invested in it.
Love me some FA cup
It sure is! Thank you!!
Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers... I never saw the movie, myself. I thought it looked pretty stupid.

Fake lous!
[NAME] fast asleep is adorable. I love how the two blonde girls are asleep and with drool.
This team will never win another super bowl with the current coaching staff. That‚Äôs my leveled emotional viewpoint
Yeah sorry about that I don't mean it.
This is lovely. Didn‚Äôt expect the end.
Really I like the new fatalities
I am twice as proud of my baby [NAME].
We haven‚Äôt heard from you in a while. Hopefully you and your kids are doing well.
Your not winning their hearts, your just torturing them and they end up hating you.
Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way.
At least you get sunny on Netflix, they took it off in Canada :(
It feels weird reading a VICE article talking about itself in the third person.
I hope this is better than The Middle I mean it's [NAME] so it's going to be decent at worst.
Oooh that's so sweet,she sounds like a good and caring mother. Does your dad know?
Oh [NAME] you idiot
You're gross
Snuggling with my boyfriend
Wow that is one part disgusting and another part a huge waste of time for expecting an entertaining payoff. Warning, this video also includes spoilers for the latest Avengers.
isnt that halloween or like easter, man people are weird
"Even [NAME] has said ""I'm happy *for you*"" to pregnant women he's known."
Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely.
That‚Äôs my favorite aquarium! Wish I saw that though lol
Mother‚Äôs Day is the worst.
Hahaha yes, exactly!
Nah let's not be those people.
"Join Wattpad! There are many great books and it's free :) If you want ""real"" books, [NAME] is definitely worth reading. "
I cant believe we elected this goon
I really applaud you for your patience...
Could you make a ten hour version? I‚Äôm tired of having to replay this so often
I have. Here, its implying he wants to fuck the dog. The original the dog is just scared of him.
Thanks for that, I just turned 35 and considering nursing and starting over too
A family friend was just found to have made this comment, I am interested to hear your thoughts. 
That live snail got me freaked
442 is how many goals we're scoring today
Completely disgusting.
good to hear my man!
Umm, zoom out. The ICO was $0.30. I only put 0.5 BTC into it then though. Wish I did more.
I love that ammunition. I want to make 200 of them, but I think you may be limited?
Yeah people demonize salt but like that's the opposite problem with restricting, salt is my friend leave me out of it
Off topic your username is awesome.
It always upset me that [NAME] would require his only son to do this I no longer believe it
I'm glad you liked it :D
Sorry pal, it‚Äôs actually one of my least favorites :/
As long as blind luck exists, there is no upper limit on stupidity.
It's not even the ads. It's the complete lack of anything worth watching between the ads.
So, that's super illegal in the U.S. And a cooler is not worth slicing someone's finger tips open. 
Honestly [NAME] is the best character on the show and the main reason it's worth watching, especially the later seasons.
You are the smiley face killer
[NAME] is definitely a good player, would probably be an [NAME] in the East, but fuck him lol
What a legend.
Cray to the crazy
And now I regret not applying when they opened one in my town even more now. Good times.
That‚Äôs another unfair accusation. I spent a lot of time trying to reach an understanding with you.
Mom will get sad. [NAME] still good. Hanging out with friends still good. Money buying foodie exp is still good.
"They're not ""likes"" you fucking moron."
Give it time. Pain like that needs to heal just like open wounds. I really hope that you will eventually start to feel better.
Sorry. Was hard to understand for me as well.
Oh haha I‚Äôm from liberal MA and started having sex younger. I come from a sex positive environment.
That‚Äôs petty debateable, there‚Äôs disagreement in the ranks but not enough to change their names or policies. 
I actually really liked that you added in your personal interests. I like Korean boy bands too.
