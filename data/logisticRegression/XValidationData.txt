The sky is actually annoying and so on (and as annoying as it makes sense. No, this is interesting how?
I mentioned it was only for three weeks. I know it’s not over yet.
>Shes completely self-made too :) Now I'm imagining her as some sort of entity that brings its own existence about
"The ""richest"" country in the worlds royal palace banquet hall filled with cheap mass produced junk food and they love it."
Major props to your mom!
Alright thanks ill try, (but thats like dark souls on ng 100 XD)

Someone did this when the roommate was breaking into her room and trying to leave dirty cat litter in it
Majority of [NAME] support Dem investigations of a foreign agent? I’m so proud!
New year home boy. You can still change. If not, 2020 is your time to shine boiii
I’m a big Spider-Man fan and this looks terrible compared to Spider-verse and the PS4 game.
It doesn't look like it.
Yelling anger sorrow. Not that funny to me.
As long as the ink isn’t on a contract, I don’t listen to any rumors. Waste of time
How stupid of [NAME] to rely on LibDems to stop the idea of referendum.
I discovered this show on the cnn docuseries about the nineties. What a terrible idea for a show 😂😂
why not? standing to me isn’t as everything i need is on the floor lol
Alright stop.
There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say
I only remember one lady, interesting. Just watched it a year ago lol.
It’s awful. I couldn’t even see the ending at all.
Cheese Most of my friends love cheese so much that I’m scared to tell them that I can barely even bring myself to eat it
Feeling this so hard right now. Virtual hug.
Lakers truly have the worst fans
Oh boy lol
[NAME] is in no way comparable to [NAME]. [NAME] is an imbecile.
:o I have one too! I didn't get anything but bullied at school, though.
funny
Fuck i know. I'm so worried for girls like me growing up now.
Yeah but scary brown people. Ever thought of that libtard? /s ^just ^^in ^^^case
Because your very wise mother KNEW who the real wankers were and she couldn't be bothered... Smart lady.
P3 hit me so hard in the feels that every time I hear a song from it or watch anything P3 related, I just burst into tears.
Thanks [NAME] for moderating, I appreciate the hard work you guys do!
It does infuriate me.
Middle guy doesn't look to fit to me. Looks like me, too many pounds.
That's not an actual thing you realise? No one is that stupid.
Damn, but I’d miss my mother. Then again she’d be all happy in her heaven. The rest of us can party. 
Sorry for having a working brain :3
I love this
I love this comment
Double barrel Pink eye. Awesome.
I can’t imagine being this retired
Fuck that its not my money they're giving him. I want a goalie with a .970 sv% dangnabbit.
I’m so sorry for your loss... if you ever want to queue PM me for my steam
It's harder to find a decent picture of him
Thanks for the confirmation
Haha I meant [NAME]. I was a very chatty fast bowler/no.6 pinch hitter.
Yay! Nice work everyone. I love reddit.
Motherfu... thanks for pointing that out!
Racism is as racism does - so yeah, goin' out and willfully doing racist shit is indeed racist. Not too hard to grasp.
Damn this is experience talking.
Same cinematographer, [NAME]. He's incredible
Yes, amazing price! Everyone I told was completely shocked!
Finally some appreciation
Not liking [NAME] is not statism. Removed.
Oh, it’s actually its own thing. I heard goo and just assumed the worst.
Hot damn! Thankfully only a bump to the head.
[NAME] blew it by putting [NAME] on the WS roster. He was horrible, and he hadn't pitched in weeks.
"Yes, after her long trip to the Swiss Alps or wherever she went to ""find herself"" lol"
What I learned last year was not to read the comment sections, because it used to get me hot!!!!! 
Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
We love our murder queen
Yes, I've noticed it too. Or the photo of the item won't load. This company is so shameful
Lol same here😖
[NAME] damn cummonists
This is great news. Congratulations!
IMAGINE ABOUT TO LOSE TO LAKERS W/O LEBRON, I FCKING LOVE THIS TEAM
Exactly, humans are selfish. That was kinda my point, my reasons are superficial and only affect me. Theirs are not. 
Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to.
I'm NoT LiKe ThOsE oThEr DeSiS.
Damn this is really uplifting.
I like the head bounce. He can ask the concussion to hold his beer, it will be strong...
Like any relationship... Communication is key 🔑 Oh yeah Please just be yourself 
Not happy.
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
Why did you repost this 7 hours after your initial post!? And to the same sub!? Yo, that's not cool man.
You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
Today I wish I were a black bear.
Wyrmwood was extremely my shit and I loved every second of it.
You've never smelled a woman on her period? It's awful.
You are in the right here, and I support your actions
I'm getting old. :/
I'm not going out of my way to watch it but I might channel flip
A video was just released showing this altercation. Within Syria is rarely wrong.
yep. I feel guilty for throwing them out but they're basically useless.
Always remember that when problems get hardcore, Pornshit will be there to Worst them.
I actually do have a really good one who specializes in emp law. He serves multiple areas. Will pM
She is so brave 😥😭
Interesting, thanks for clarifying.
I haven’t seen this format before. And I don’t even know if it’s original. But I like it.
Fair enough good point
The last message was particularly painful to read
ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator
We are very clumsy creatures. Eventually you just learn to laugh it off. *The crying comes later when no one is around*
I really like the hot pot at Lucky Bamboo. Their dim sum made me sad.
[NAME] lmao
Seems like you're another guy who hates legion ;D
Sure, but he still died again a couple of years (decades?) later. So the copyright is still up.
"A ""Texas DUI"" sounds like a weird sex move. "
Fuck her. I hate her so much. I wish she’s just vanish back to Indonesia with her mustache.
This. One of my biggest pet peeves. What the hell does it even mean?
Did she do it yet? I refuse to look.
Oh I went balls to the wall and got SUPER SPECIFIC!!!
It's back up now. Sorry for the mess with moderation, wasn't our fault.
Good luck with that!
I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
saved... i'll enjoy this video
I sure hope by all falls down you mean all mine and by the workout plan you're talking about the skit and not the song
"I reject that [NAME] can't defend. Now his legs being gone, that might ""have legs"" "
Nice of them to call back to [NAME] dyslexia with the two different spellings of deodorant
My bad. Was half asleep while typing and couldn’t remember how to spell😂 I just let autocorrect take over, thanks! Lol
That trade turned out to be a complete disaster for us. Too bad.
We're a community, like it or not. This came from us and we need to hold eachother to a higher standard of behavior.
Dude... are you okay?
Nice try FBI.
Look everyone it's that boy that laughs at everybody! Let's laugh at him!
Thanks for this detailed response, it's given me a good understanding of what I am dealing with
I drove through there dropping off an uber passenger and I was really amazed by how beautiful it is.
i want the little polly pocket heart purse so bad but i ain't paying hot topic $40 for it
It was a pretty shit joke that deserves it
Nah, I think it's being as dull as a butter knife.
Girl YES. My kindergarten come back Tuesday, and I’m hoping they remember my name and how to hold a pencil.
Ah, my bad. Always mix em up. Thanks for the correction!
From red deer as well. Don't worry not all of us are ignorant and hateful.
I dont mind these people dying, what bothers me is that some random bystander could be smashed by this guy should he fall
The two most talented receivers [NAME] had, [NAME] and [NAME], had their careers interrupted by injuries and nonsense.
Oh my bad hahaha
Assassins Creed Odyssey is awesome, as well as Shadow of War. Both great adventure games.
Get some deodorant and soray her every time shr sprays the cat
No, not sarcastically :) 
Yayy we agree on something. I mean everything's on fire but we agree haha
Yeah, it does that to me on my laptop. Nothing just happens. If I try on mobile I just get that error message.
Takes a lot of courage to admit they are autistic online. Nice to see you worked up the courage buddy!
I have faith that you do it *correctly*
Hot damn.
Oh wow, hate that. 
So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
He hates the Falcon because his dad would leave him all the time on it as a kid
I think it may be interesting if the public could vote for films.
What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Upvoted.
You die > mom will be sad
Honestly if you had to live in punchbowl you’d be angry too
Well, I’ll be here when you fail!
Ok so the scape goat is gone. No more excuses now [NAME].
Yeah Stupid Sexy groening
Our performance was an embarrassment and should never have happened. It's a bottom of the league style performance against top.
I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.
I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.
Congratulations!! How are you feeling/doing these days?
I'm very motivated to make things as easy/optimized as possible so that I can be as lazy as possible.
I'd hate to see the [NAME] be reduced to a drunk junker. You know, like REYS parents are. 
Yes, that might be a good thing
Thankyou so much
Poor thing. Her arm looked stuck in the crutch as she fell. That had to hurt
That’s awesome! Good call :) settling my alarm now m/
I understand that the fear that you will need to have surgery is very upsetting. But, there is no legal case here. 
Hey everybody we got us an optimist here.
Let people enjoy things
Oh lol. I always just typed them out manually. :hamsad:
Exactly. Thank you.
Yeah agreed, it’s great to see!
Thank you. Language is weird. Why do you have multiple words for the same thing?
No matter how hard you scrub it WON'T COME OUT.
Now THAT is a murder by words!
Weird thing, but my cat will go HAM on my earhole if I let her.
Damn, I didn’t see any monkeys when I was there! What a ripoff.
Just so freaking miserable. Trying to make me miserable as well
And Arsenal fans hated him as he left them for his boyhood club, which made his great performances against them all the sweeter
yeah definitely so what i'm thinking is, we remake it, but also, add a divekick button
Sorry, I meant let them know outside of class.
I love the title of it - “Everything Is Going to Be Okay”
Ooooh that was a missed opportunity
I don't like [NAME] this season but she's always been a favorite before. Am I the only one? She has an edge that seems unlikable
I don’t remember [NAME] saying that tbh
But don't you see it! How dare she show two inches of skin...
Alright, so I googled aaaaaaand sorry for my misinformed mistake. Dunno where I heard that [NAME] didn't win the popular vote but it was wrong :(
And if she isn't? That relationship could be wrecked and your friend destroyed for nothing
You had great seats!
Who the hell has all these power tools but no hammer
Oh that also would have been good. Plus, breaking pottery is so satisfying
The slam final I want, [NAME] vs [NAME]. The slam final we'll get, [NAME] vs [NAME].
That sucks. I had to deal with something similar. Sorry you go through this.
A crime more sinister cannot be imagined!
I like how this story's problem is literally the opposite of the next oldest post on this subreddit
wait, no more [NAME] SJW pwned vids in my recommended? YOU DARE DISGRACE OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR?
i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
Cool. Would be happy to know if this worked out for you. I had wasted a bunch of time like you did and was getting frustrated.
I appreciate that. :)
It is bad tho.
Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
Why are you so fucking concerned with what someone else uses to clean their teeth? You sound like a toothpaste troll.
I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.
Considering I’m majoring in politics, that’s the plan!!! Thank you! 
Now it's a double birth stone, so it's extra special!
Bisbee is a weird place.
World has Turned and Left Me Here.
This, be yourself she likes you for who you are.
What a shame... she was passing really well too...
Damn thats so cheap
Deflections don't help your cause.
Yep, they expect you to revolve around them, but think they’re exempt from returning the favour. 
I dislike [NAME] more and more. Big ego and small feet.
Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that
We've sucked ever since he got here. Just saying
I am clueless lately. None of my students parents speak English. It breaks my heart because I want to have more open communication.
Close the door, you're letting the heat out!
Picture was gorgeous. What TV is that?
Wow! I just played my self
That's a welcome relief. Lol.
Nobody has guns in NYC, they're ilegal there lol.
The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.
This video is funny but every time I watch it I get so mad at the guys filming and their belittling comments!
What does that have to do with [NAME] having sex with a child, what's the point you're trying to make with that piece of information?
I tried it that way first and thought this was better, thanks for the input though! 
I heard about that too
If you google translate it means “nugget” which I find hilarious.
I just see a car incessantly hogging the middle lane despite being undertaken on the inside!
And this is why men are so against #believewoman
Oh [NAME] please don’t put them in a team together.
Good tips. Will take into consideration everything you said. Thanks a lot !
The important thing is that you're having fun
"I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
But they still go around the houses, 111 is long as fuck though.
**KICK HIS ASS SEABASS**
Thank you for answering. It's much appreciated.
I want to get rough with him. Choking, tying me up, light BDSM.
>Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
I don't care it's amazing there lol
You can't just make bold claims like that and provide no evidence.
Yes, its completely normal. Everyone I know is better than everyone else.
Always great to see a fellow [NAME] give proper advice
This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!
That sucks, I hope you find the finances to be able to go back to it someday.
Her camel toe is strong!
This sounds so painful. I am so sorry. This ED is literally a demon.
That's how you're supposed to serve a pretzel, so it doesn't go soggy whilst lying flat on a plate. 
Jolex because [NAME] grated on my nerves so bad
Lmao the revolution is here haha
I second that. What goes up must come down. And to OP, i hope you find peace and clarity. Good luck!
I'm sorry for your loss
This will pass and you will be happy again. Just not right now. Hang in there.
From the South and can confirm that [NAME] is an idiot and should be saying brink.
Damn that was ugly
But seriously, you're probably going to feel very sick 
Tell him he needs to go to rehab or he’ll be kicked out.
Hope this place will still be around in a few years time!
It’s really sad to see
Well I get annoyed when they dont, because I'm always the one to answer within 30 seconds.
Thank you. It doesn't sound so bad, at least on paper.
This is the bus station way outside the city center and nowhere near the sea Edit: Unfortunately Turkey does lack aesthetic appeal outside Istanbul tourist areas
Sounds painful man
I’m not a detective, but I don’t think it was her. 
Meh, I still rock my Burns jersey with pride. 
I’m not an Aub man. Check the flair.
MEEEEEEEEE. Most people don't get my humour, but every now and then somebody does and we non-stop laugh together. 
Amazing work!. I truly enjoyed reading this and read like a page directly from the book.
Sometimes i think i am cringe, but then i see these people and feel a little better
Horray for Persona
[NAME] dirty talk really just Doesnt Work for me. Sounds silly at the best of times.
This comment is complete garbage.
It feels weird to me cause im the type of person who always immediately texts back
Hey at least we’re still 5th after losing 2 straight.
So excited for this!! Thanks to all who have worked so hard to put this together <3
It's always nice to tell someone a pleasant story before they go to sleep.
[NAME] is [NAME].
When you stop making garbage takes, I'll stop correcting them
Aw, good times, picking off them pesky 'tennas and coyotes! Me too, I'd love that! Thank you for playing, my friend!
"Without even talking about diabetes, you really must be an asshole to celebrate overeating and call it ""progress"""
It's time to feel the fucking Bern, America. 
Wooow! [NAME] hitting [NAME] with that question! Can’t wait to see that!
[NAME]! You made me the happiest girl that could eva be!
Did we see the same scene? [NAME] takes it like a champ. You *gain* points for turning her down.
Sorry, I don’t see a difference. If you are opposing people’s access to something, your opposing that thing.
[NAME] is scary
Yes get [NAME] almost all the way the fuck out of here.
This will either be a classic or a complete shitshow
yes, i fucking hate that.
Damn bro thats wack. But life has a way to with things she'll reap what she sows. Feel better
"It's pretty stupid honestly. [NAME] clearly pointed a bug and people are saying ""oh, it's a feature"". ...seriously now."
Agree with [NAME] and yang I only really liked [NAME] for a little bit she irritated me
You’re a joke
[NAME] endorsed [NAME], for one epic fail in that regard. I prefer to make my own informed judgement call, thank you very much
He has been given all the time/freedom in the world - he just doesn't deliver.
because you are in danger of appropriating methhead culture.
You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon
Somebody is really insecure about their career decisions.
Im retarded lmao Etiz/flualp
what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
Beyond nightmare!!
I'm two weeks in, hope your right, I'm loving the game right now
It's not like the picture looks bad. Wait, no, I take that back immediately. I can't unsee it now too.
This actually made me laugh out loud
Kill it with fire.
Seriously beautiful my man!! Is it on apple music? Really great song
It's rigor mortis but don't change it haha it's funny, good r/boneappletea material
Lol I don’t think it’ll change anything.
your character's so broken!
That's super fricking cool I love it
YOU'RE CORRECT AND YET THEY ARE CORRECT ALSO
The fufure is not written! But my skateboard career is!
They've actually gotten a bit worse :D Started with just a dry cough, now it's pain swallowing, stuffed nose, but the cough is now better
Stop, your hurting me!
I like [NAME]. Sue me.
Hard to believe we scored like 8 points through the first 6 minutes.
Sorry, I misread
But it’s so hideous
Good luck!
"""IT'S GET YOUR GAME ON! SAY IT RIGHT!"""
Thank you.
Where is you fur, human? You're a disgrace for all young generations
This is painfully fake
Nice I am actually going to the game! Awesome I'll get to see him represent.
"Basic translation ""I'd rape you if I weren't a virgin!"" Super creepy."
So cynical! 🙄 😂
Large weight fluctuations + a baby have caused my body to look cute in clothes -- Not so cute without them.
Ya i hate to talk bad about don’t but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community
He has actively lied about and misrepresented Canadian laws and legislation, even after he's been corrected. 
This seems like a colossally unimportant thing to sign a petition over.
Hahah is that what we call them here? Breeders? I'm not trying to be condescending that's just hilarious.
He wants to make excuses for his affair and I doubt you'll feel better after listening to him. In fact, you may actually feel worse. 
"Watch ""Garfunkel and Oates - The Loophole"" if you haven't already"
No femshaming, guys.
As a household we deal with it by respecting each other's choices and opinions.
This gave me a laugh on this shity day thank you
a partner of mine made it -- it's just about my favorite meme ever
I'm very open to doing anything to help me abstain. This seems very helpful I'd love to know more.
Sorry I thought you called me dumb. Long story. A misunderstanding. Sorry
My favorite one that you’ve made so far haha Great work
>a fun activity!!! At no point in my TBM life would I have found that fun or worthy of even one exclamation.
I know! I would absolutely do this as well. I’d love to to a AMA with him to find out more.
The only thing I remember about that guy was the super racist remarks he made about [NAME].
For us to be able to do that now, they would proably make us pay for it. 
The US version of The Office isn’t even the best version of The Office, never mind the best comedy ever.
maybe post the article since it's already out lol
Missed it by 4 minutes
it looks like she took it in a totally different direction which i’m loving
Close your damn mouth before it catches a fly
It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill
This made me sad
He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!
What a muffin!
Thanks :)
I went to the pharmacy to get vaccinated (sign said for free) and they turned me down for not having health insurance... so
Better scoop it up quick. Lots of hunters out there lol
You’re gorgeous girl! 🔥😊
Have a good night, mate!
[NAME] play fake mad is great. Sitting there starring like he’s the most hardcore fan there is
I am just asking for job-advice. I have dealt with this condition for a long time, and know what medical therapies are effective and feasible for me. Thanks
Future is bright to me!
Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
Don’t make fun of the cancer kid
Get this religious bullshit out of here smh [NAME] doesn't give a fuck about who wins or losses a child's game
Man it's so cringy. Can't I like Classic Rock AND hip-hop? smh btw he forgot the beatles, just sayin...
It's tasty. Had one on bone marrow once. I've had weirder things before
Sorry, sometimes I really can't tell in here. 
I'm tall but no one is attracted to me, because I'm ugly, I have a big nose and ears.
This is beautiful!
Well in that case, i'll agree with you. I guess we can all do without scholars. 
Ok but wouldnt that make me seem like a loser? Idek how to take good selfies or even where. Obviously not the bathroom right?
Aww this made me tear up! Please keep posting your poems, they are so special ♥️
Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now
Dude, let’s just offer them a choice between remaining and staying. Democracy, lmao.
I think they are tied together. It is very difficult to maintain desire if you cannot accept things about that person.
The 2nd worst president. First time i voted. Been trying to live it down ever since
Counter's clean, you're welcome!
Ya know... a helmet never hurt anyone
It's not you, Taco Bell is grade D racoon meat and isn't fit for human consumption.
You’re truly welcome :)
[NAME] damit you got me! Take your upvote sir!
I should have said without nuts in hindsight, but this woman was ready to kill. Gotta love hospitality sometimes.
Yes? FBI? This Lady Right here..
That's good to hear. I'm admittedly highly judgmental about this kind of thing but I'm trying to open up my mind a bit.
I have pretty bad anxiety and have recently adopted two kittens. I definitely feel less anxious when I'm around them as they are such sweet animals.
No way a tattooed ex-con with a drug/drinking problem might turn abusive!
Not about my first name but I'm gonna change my last name.
I know right, im pre everything but sometimes i paint my nails and people will tell me how much they look like a womands hands.
Yes, very sad but that's the reality of competitive online gaming right now
I like your sleeves... they’re real big
Gotta love guarantee. You should come over to amtrak, at most crew bases it only takes two years to hold a job.
I feel sorry for him. He gotta be an awkward guy who has no friends.
[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league.
Hope you're ok!
There must be some awful things happening right at this second
Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them.
>Missing skillset >Guy I mean, I don't want to say it's *free*, but it's pretty damn likely.
Ah cool, i heard more or less the same story but in Newcastle. 
You have no idea how incredible they make me feel in every single way. It's not something I'm used to!!
I just shit my pants. Then walk away. Embarrassing enough he won't press or follow you.
I would say. ’good’ but it’s all fucking tragic.
[NAME] these things were terrible. i presume they still are. #teamlemoncreams
Yeah I realised that a bit too late. I still wanted to further explain myself regardless but thank you for being nice about it.
Loved every part of this series so far!! Keep up the good work!
oh ok thanks for explaining
That sucks. Learn to check your ping like everyone else.
Happy cake day!
You have no idea how high I can fly.
Yeah, I see you’re point. Thank you
Women wear makeup to threaten other women. It has nothing to do with men. Same w all their weird mutilations.
Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
Well said man. I hope you’re doing better now. Love the username btw.
I hope your life is as lovely as you are
All the time, you just sort of accept it round here. Butt-hurt mombies and bitter regretful daddicts are what I usually chalk it up to.
Beautiful. Makes me wonder how the Persona 6 Velvet Room attendant will be like and how the dynamic with their siblings go...
Glad this waste of time is over. Lets get back to the business of fixing this team.
Reject your humanity voluntarily and put the pure hatred, lack of moral, sociopathy and sadistic altitude inside of your soul with no way to turn back.
NCAA is a poor barometer for scoring. [NAME] was leading scorer in all NCAA for like 3 years running. Not even sure he got drafted.
Yea, I saw him live in Stockholm. It was awesome!
I feel you. I hate needles and i'm a type 1 diabetic
LOL I read that and slavated. I wish we could pull that sweet of a deal off.
I had corrected myself but I deleted the original post now for people like yourself who don’t read fully before you get enraged and comment.
Is that the only symptoms you’ve noticed? Are you normally worried for social situation?
[NAME] nerds thinking they are cool by assigning some bullshit fantasy words to error messages...theater mode is probably just acting up
It's a shitty made shirt but if it was done well I'd wear it.
I think it’s impressive. It’s actually fairly difficult to be that slick for that long.
Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.
Oh please lol
I’m from Oklahoma City. Not a small city, but a few of his patients are from there.
Your spine is so shiny! Good for you!
Crap company that old folks love cause of the name Only useful benefit is towing
It’s called concern trolling. Don’t be so gullible and quick to politicize everything.
Please kind sir may I have some more
Thanks dude! I do best with the ice, swat and maddox
Happy to be able to help.
Both teams played fantastically defensively, just because it’s not a 10 goal game doesn’t mean anyone played badly. 
We gotta throw the whole world away
Washington Post is garbage because it prints garbage. I'll go with the decision by the experts thanks.
[NAME] will probably get something as worse as [NAME] in ep4
This dude was super cool
Oh thank [NAME]
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
Cruelty free for animals anyway. 🤦
Thank you very much that was quite swell of u sire
Drink off those hangovers boys, we have the best team in the universe to watch
Go in appropriate attire with several copies of your resume and list of references! Good luck!
you should have asked this question 15 years ago sadly :(
You’re as cool as a hand-job on a honeymoon. Go draw some anime and cry yourself to sleep.
As much fun as I've had yanking their chains, does anyone know the background behind these particular scam calls? I've gotten several of them lately.
Haha came here to say this, that shit spun me out right proper it did!
Feels good to be a Nets fan right now
He’s been shit. Makes the wrong decision in the final third every time this game.
Back in my day the only bars you could find were real ones👴
Exactly. He is doing a diet trend that just happens to be meat-free.
No, that's Generation Z. Instagram is their fault.
We cant say dodgeball these days. It’s forbidden. Like how we call anal sex “Lawyer love” now.
Start an initiative to take away cops guns since you feel so strongly about it
. beautiful you have a way with words here
_Ooh, it looks like we just sold the last one earlier today_
I'd give it a 9/10 one of my favorites. So what was your thoughts on D'jango?
Good lad!
Congrats! Glad it went well for you!
>the satisfaction of knowing how bent out of shape you're getting What a sad existence.
Little scrub didn't even make it through the first week of NN19.
it only flatters them when they’re posed a certain way. but other than that, it looks awful and uncomfortable
Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.
Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms.
Bahahaha this is gold.
pretty ironic this was recorded
Idk about you but I will accept my easy win if a Tiandi or Shaolin spam their 400ms lights
Yeah, i dont know bout you guys, but my parents were pretty anal about my room being clean.
Just hearing that thing's carapace sliding around and it's feet hitting the ground would make me vomit.
Everything. Everything is wrong with being hypocritical.
UNLIMITED POWER!
I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her.
Thank you kindly :)
Well shit, time to talk to the wife. It appears she has two husbands.
This is genius! I’m going to start doing this now too. Thanks!
“stay still” the best and most timely advice you’ll ever get.
Now, remember, this is a very dulled version of what were used to considering they’re still riding the super bowl high from last year. 
In the 50s my aunt was 6 weeks old when a flu virus caused inflammation of the heart and she died. So there's that, too.
Ah yes January, the worst time of the year at the gym 
Everything he does makes me love him, including his video application for his job at Polygon which is art.
are you dumb bro? please watch again and don’t downvote me for stating facts. holy shit you’re inept.
Before the ~~Empire~~ MousePire. ooo ooo Mouse Pyre ! lol
Its a tough thing, but our government NEEDS to be downsized drastically. I just hope the affected employees have help with the transition.
Doesn’t sound like it’s going to work out, sorry dude
The wolves have been bad for so long that I actually did completely give up watching basketball.
As someone who is Scandinavian, you have to admit that [NAME] are either short or VERY tall.
Interesting read, thanks. Still a 40% bust rate. Sucks that someone's job is on the line with that high of a chance of failing. 
This is not a legal issue. Take it up with your school if you don't agree with it.
I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
But then they couldn't be a self-martyring, violent tankie and that's not as much fun.
How can anyone like Tottenham? Like for real. They are the worst team you could imagine in every department.
I hate it when mom and dad fight.
Proud [NAME], proud European. There are at least 16m of us.
A machine would literally do a worse job than him.
No it hasn't.
“So even if vaccination did cause autism...WHICH IT FUCKING DOESN’T!” Pure genius.
She is renowned for her versatility.
Funny that dinner sized is larger than lunch sized wherever you are. Seems like a very specific cultural thing.
You gotta block the name out, sweets.
what the fuck
Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. 
Oh, sweet. It's the gaming guy who hasn't uploaded any gaming videos yet! /s (I like him and am just poking fun)
Seahawks fans are very bad at just taking the L.
He sounded so disappointed when he realized they just wanted sex :( Poor OP!
Haha, yes.
I seen a video, must have been one of the students where they've completely surrounded the [NAME]. 
Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd.
Fuuuuck that's rough
I always wondered what turned the deer albino. Must have been from fright.
I wasn't aware of that subreddit before. Thanks for reading and for the recommendation!
Not censoring usernames is against Reddit’s rules...
Stop crying.
I would love to be woken up by that
[NAME] engagement photo shoot This is the best she has ever looked in my opinion. HAWT!
Both look great, but I like the second one better. I'm a dude though and I have no sense of what works for other guys.
That's the best catch I've ever seen
Oh well, very nice then :)
I think it's the pass rush and that nobody can stay healthy and, but it could be [NAME]. He's not the greatest
There is an actual subreddit for cheating. It's disgusting.
Yeah I regret ever moving to Leduc. It's one of the most backwoods, proud-to-be-ignorant communities I've ever seen.
[NAME] sorry it was rude not to @ you lol
I don’t like it.
I'm crying.
I think you need a better partner. Continuing to go after you said you want to stop is kind of abusive.
Can we ban posts about him now he's a predator? It just makes me sad now, Idk about anyone else
Sorry, but this was already on our front page recently, so I'm gonna have to remove it. 
Plus the idea of a choose your own adventure movie is absolutely exciting and brings more chances to go back through
Nasty, pigeons are nasty.
She isn't disrespectful like [NAME] but she's also a cheater and she's making ridiculous excuses for her cheating
oh thats a good one ;)
Wall St is scared of the 2020 Democratic primary.. Good!
Fuck the White House, fuck McDonald’s and fuck this post.
That face in 0:18. That's the face of happiness
Haha I've got a mild case of UC, maybe I should be more dramatic about it and use it!
>Poly people look at the numbers and just see lots of opportunities ;) I like how that's put
Disgusting. Truly disgusting.
Lmao you fart bigger to cover up the first one
Tis nothing but a scratch
They should wear the Burger King too
War is quite different than state sponsored democide.
That would be really rough. However she is so incompetent I wouldn’t be surprised if she self immolates
My man!
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
Happy birthday and I'm really glad I won't be feeling like you when you wake up tomorrow
[NAME]. 
Fuck calm down [NAME]
"New word for me: tetch·y /ˈteCHē/ adjective bad-tempered and irritable. ""she had always been tetchy and impatient with him"""
Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF
Back in the day was the best ever than. I giggled nearly to the point of drenching my depends. Ty ty very much.
I'll try. Thank you
Who tf told you that weirdo is left?
That tiny shoulder pad is freaking adorable.
We have the problem and just started a group for couples without kids to make friends on Facebook this past weekend.
Nah I’m good. I like my parents and their food.
Let's do this... 4 game win streak again!
ARGH!!
Thanks for the link! I've been looking too and there are like 200 in the area I called one and waiting to hear back.
You are grieving a hard loss, and might benefit from some grief therapy.
Anybody else feel super weird when you see your dad get hurt? It’s a weird thing to see
I still miss the north hills bottom dollar :(
Just like you can't underestimate the capacity for evil, you can't underestimate the capacity for stupidity 
Oh my gosh, my Dodger blue heart goes out to yours and your family. I am so sorry.
Silver is actually not bad in terms of people playing good comps... its when you get to low gold and high gold that keep me liking silver lmao.
I cringe at every part of all of this
OMG BARF wtf is wrong with people?!
All ur damage should have overflowed.. So just choose the best looking one.
Unfortunately not.
This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'
Great questions. I don't have the answer, but I'm happy that were starting to discuss it.
It's a hit headline from coin desk that has nothing to do with the article--which is glowingly positive for Ethereum and the Ethereum space.
Are you serious? Open up a fucking history book
Yeah he does give intense and memorable performances. He didn't get to speak in Mad Max for like half an hour but he was still riveting.
[NAME] ignored [NAME] and I loved it
You are AMAZING. I especially love the woman !! :)
bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man
Heaven forbid you do some actual research.
How are we going to get a high 2021 pick? Unless we lose a ton of games of course.
Far more to do with being entirely irresponsible and dumb than anything related to benefits or tax claims.
The rest areas and truck stops are booming!
6'3 guy who wants to be the smaller guy here, [NAME] i feel you
Sorry !! You’re real good at that!!
❤️ you are a strong individual and there is an amazing amount of support behind you
No. It’s not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
You are, or you're. Thanks
Thanks bro means a lot
Thanks, this really helps!
I think the mushroom photos are a joke about his penis.......
We both will be having a read at these links, thank you! 
I feel the r/thathappened for more than half of the stories posted. But they're fun to read.
Its not better then PoE.....by a longshot.
She has naturally chubby cheeks that are set on high cheekbones. I've seen it before and it's not abnormal.
How is it the worst though? Me and my friends all use it and love it (since 2016)
YOU SUFFER ON YOUTUBE WITH THE REST OF US.....or you buy their CDs and rip em onto the computer <3
Well, my upcoming adverts are going to be interesting!
I am too but thank you for having it and I will try to think more about the points you raised.
“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.
Youre not wrong, but that applies to every ad. People are generally getting upset with the message more than anything though
I’m jealous.
Thanks, do we know how this document has been publicised, and if it's not a fake document 
This is amazing!
No no, you don't thank a bot you say good bot Also happy cake day
I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.
What's there to disagree on..... it's pretty apparent
what an idiot
I'd give it a 6.9, based on the fact that he was still caught in the tree
Imagine thinking like this. I feel kinda bad for them.
Stupid Sexy [NAME]
Great. So increase prices 20% overall, give the waiters the extra money. I'm happy with that. 20% is a great tip.
Good for you, [NAME]! You deserved a nice drink to end a year where you made an impact in peoples lives! Cheers!
You sound angry.
That goddamn wink slayed me. Swoon so hard...
They mug you and ruin the country
Thanks for cheering me up!?
Shrug, ndp is still going to lose. I don’t really care how many there are.
Ahh, thanks for the response.
Funny how artificial famines are genocide when the Brits do it, but not when it's the Soviets. 
You're not [NAME] about your joke, good pun there mate
Why the fuck are you smiling for? Fuck you.
I laughed at this harder than I'd expected to. Also, joke's on them when those turds freeze solid like everything else in the Midwest rn.
Sure, they can help nurse [NAME] back to health. 
Thanks...One year in making, I hope it gets the love it deserve. 
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
I'm sure he'd love to do that. Just have to get a few others on board first haha.
Ah thanks for the tip.
I think [NAME] is honestly just a whack job.
Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea
Lol. 'have meat on my bones and I'm thick'. Just 'overweight' will do, Captain Redundant.
> Waaah the reward I get for being a decent human being isn’t good enough.
His name also references UGA.
Thanks for the link. She actually likes some of the stuff!
all good haha 👍
Thank you mate.
I'll kill you.
I guess you were hoping for love from someone who is not well enough to offer love.
Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
Great protest! Not being discouraged by the weather or paternalistic criticism, good on them!
Yawning at the insults to me, not the Woman
[NAME] belongs to no one.
Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...
It’s fun until you’re looking back
Because it's straight up untrue. It's a new ce idea but anyone relying on the sentiment is going to be repeatedly disappointed.
100%,I'm actually impressed
Thank you! We’re currently shoveling ourselves out of the driveway, hopefully well be going there soon
The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.
Block the number, avoid your parents, and cut the toxic people out of your life.
Having this issue as well it really does me in
That was the first thing we tried and we could not get it to work.
WAIT IS THIS FUCKING LOSS!?!
There's always something endearing about a reply trying to keep the enthusiasm going. You enjoy that new toy as much as you can.
Fool you twice, shame on you
At this point, LSC only exists to give socialists a bad name.
And in the case of human trafficking, these people we should be given homes and protection instead of being tossed out to be abused in their home country
Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.
Oh [NAME] lol the cringe is palpable
Bay Area, sorry ;D
This doesn't solve the problem of people using controllers, they make it harder for everyone low rank or not
Her promo's alone would be a great addition to the promotion.
Haha its okay!
The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
I wishhhh. She’s honestly what started getting me the fuck away from centrism
Test levels have been dropping significantly It’s well documented Why do you think that’s stupid
Explain why you think it’s not. Not that I disagree, but explain your thoughts.
"It's ironic that those who most strongly embrace TSSC and other churches are so often utterly lacking in any level of true ""faith."""
Amazing. You will defend [NAME] no matter what huh?
"Lmao the cop stops like *""Fuck, well I guess he won't be resisting on the way""*"
What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
Have you told this story before? It seems really familiar.
[NAME] done fucked up.
That sounds very sketchy to me. I would be thinking he’s with another girl TBH
Ahhh, I was curious about that since I do both Postmates and IC at the same time.
Probably fans of aftv. Bunch of utterly dirty cunts!
Someone you guys are on Grindr just to screenshot your own witty replies to men trying to bang you, don’t deny it.
Thank you! That's the explanation I was looking for.
Good for you. But ignoring [NAME] situation makes the article pointless.
new genders about to drop doesn’t strike me as a bad joke tbh.
Oh I know. I will never forget either of those scenes, poor kid.
*[NAME] playing the world's saddest tune on the world's biggest violin.*
bleh. You would think 160 reps in and I wouldn't have that problem. Thanks for the insight.
Sure, sorry for late response.
I think it’s funny, especially those eyes! Lol
That’s awesome, congrats! 
I just see yes
Every YouTube comment: [NAME] is beautiful and perfect how dare [NAME] and [NAME] breath near her, the production are forcing them on us.
Nice ;)
I guess the answer is pretty obvious too lol. It would be silly if you posted “[NAME] too...” the bucs?
$100 says your boyfriend is miserable.
People who WANT a border wall: idiots, racists.
You can't compare general economic losses to tax funded expenditures. It would only be fair if we lost 5 billion in tax revenue.
That's some bitchy whore
check out victim of ritual he's one of the best [NAME] players around and he uses a pad. It's nothing you can't get used to
You can't be serious
Ah brilliant, thanks for sharing that. It does indeed look promising. Shame no mention of Lethals possibly but oh well =]
Also thanks to 4chan
Give it time.
Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
Understandable. Thank you for your opinion. Ill move towards due action soon.
Most of my friends are [NAME], and I respect them. I don't think they'd be offended. Sincerely. 
at this point if you couldnt figure out that most [NAME] here dont actually support [NAME], you must have some problems
no it's not
I have this in my waiting list, I can't wait to see it. 
I'm glad people with such foresight are the first to find this place unaffordable. Good riddance.
He got all ball. Watch it back. Just because he hits the ground hard doesn’t mean you get a bailout
Oh sorry, I forgot there isn’t any paperwork involved in getting a gun.
Back in the days when you didn't have to spend almost $10 return for a simple train journey. Thanks, IPART. 
I have literally been waiting for a “ [NAME]” I’m from Ontario Canada and love Texas.
Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
I was already taking a break from basketball this season, but I think this really put the final nail in the coffin. This team is hopeless. 
You’re the coward! I was the second man to walk on the moon. NEIL BEFORE ME.
This is almost worse than Santa Con. Can we get millenials to destroy this please.
"Given that the murder rate is primarily caused by the so-called ""war on drugs"", I don't see how gun laws would affect it at all. "
It’s totally my hardest game, too! Congrats to us all! :)
Nothing wrong with pasta or bread. Stop buying bleached flour products and get whole grain.
Rofl this pysyk kid is a disgrace
I am so sorry. My kids are the only thing keeping me going. The loneliness is agony.
Those splits of Marla's still amaze me! Not only in terms of flexibility, but STRENGTH. Just imagine how heavy that leg is...
I became a member in the summer and have still not gotten my packet, your post just gave me hope it still might come
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, I'm REALLY not ready.
Look, I knew the end of that last sentence in my mind. It's not my fault you can't keep up.
Amen to that!
It's not internalized homophobia, it's literally just an annoying voice.
I know what you mean and with me, I love animals. Do you have any hobbies you like to do? 
Yeah lets celebrate that only one guy (well maybe put dirk and [NAME] up with him) has come to play.
Wow, that was fast
I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
That’s so wholesome.
Happy birthday!! Lots of love and hugs from a stranger in Hanoi 🤗🤗
What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
Ahhh, my birthday month. I must go.. 
Perfect. Thanks!
[NAME] is on fire!!!
Mark it nsfw just to mess with people. Worst title I have seen all week.
That's because there are a lot of other attrocities that have happened since then. [NAME] aren't the only ones facing discrimination.
she disrespected [NAME], i dont like her
He has been horrible in pull up situations but not horrible with catch and shoot this season.
This is a very cool option!
I frequently have issues with these large temperature swing but it has to due with allergy pollen activation.
You monster! Think of the children!
The concept, design and artwork are gorgeous. I would love to buy this skin if it was available in game. 
Yeah I guess in perspective it really isn't a big number at all.
I feel like there's some shenanigans in place here.
I feel uncomfortable how we didn’t see him resurface...
I’m broke as shit and already do that.
Ok sure that’s a nice unfounded opinion you’ve got there. Unless you’ve been in one in which case wow sorry
This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
Thank you for your inspiration
Nothing like a little bit of whataboutism. We can think they're *both* idiots.
What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube
Me too! Just figured out how.
already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame.
Post this on /r/nba lol
Devils fan here: how good is [NAME]? I'm watching this game and was wondering how he's been and what his potential is
Seems like you care way too much
Better try next time. Remember to apply yourself and learn history instead of getting angry.
Go watch the video where she does [NAME] makeup, [NAME] is super tall, especially compared to [NAME]. 
Well he abused his previous girlfriend, he ran a porn site that's what I know
DoorDash can deliver my White Castle's at 3am, that makes me happy
You may be harder on yourself than necessary. Keep praying and confessing your sins. No one is perfect
Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t do this to me.
It's funny because [NAME] actually transformed his play after he left Bulls and evemtually signed with Heat. Would be hilarious if [NAME] did something similar
too bad nothing came off it
As horrible as it is to say, evidently the voting population doesn't care enough to make a large impact. 
I'm sorry to hear, come see me when you die.
Good lord I can only hope so. Time will have to tell.
It looks like someone screwed up.
Yeah me, I'm blaming my medication tho.
Fucking hell! I've been out there protesting orange people all this time. I need funding for new signs!
Then keep your hands visible and fight the ticket in court. Don’t understand how this is such a complex issue.
Still seems to exist. I'll check it out. Thanks!
I do play League of legends and [NAME] is my favorite character that's why my name has Thresh in it :)
Omg I am so grateful for attending your TED Talk. (Not being sarcastic, btw. This is great)
Aww... she'll probably come around eventually, I'm sure she was just jealous of [NAME]... I mean, what woman wouldn't be! lol 
You're analogies are terrible and prove the opposite of what you were arguing, numb skull 😂
Honestly, it's a part of goth style to look unnatural/alien/ethereal. 
Abstaining is dumb, she should’ve voted no
"Wow....thank you...you just ""woke"" me up :) "
My childhood horse died due to twisted intestines. Very traumatizing, since he crawled over and put his head in my lap at the end.
Happy to hear that :). Where are you from btw?
i do not like the dollar store [NAME].
I couldn't even get an internship for Human Resources without having 2-3 years 'Real World' experience. Still in customer service, with a ton of debt. 
Ditto!!
That's the worst urinal ever.
the whole thing, it was just hard to describe/express given how it all happened and everything. 
Everyone panics when they are on fire.
You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it...
Well. That's your belief. I know you and the next cant tell me how to raise mine so I'm not worried about all that.
What an awful last 10 minutes. Can't even make one pass to someone.
ah. I see :) Still brave of you.
Man.. I really loved that team.
YOU DON'T GET TO JUDGE ME!
SHUT THAT SOFT ASS SHIT UP
That is disgusting. And not one parent thought that was a *bit* inappropriate? smh
I’m sure you could find some unsatisfied women looking for a hook up.
Your team lacks ethics.
Uh no. He hates [NAME]. Not in A kayfabe way. He doesn't like [NAME] at all.
There is such a thing as too big, but this ain’t it, chief. Any bigger I would probably agree.
What a manipulative, child of a man. Jeez, grow up.
And it’s not like he was a bad coach. We’ve been spoiled from all our great seasons.
That sounds awful. Glad its from 4Chan, so I know its fake.
Haha love it we'll uhm not the penis
What a load of old shite.
That has to be the saddest nba account ever. Like 4 likes every post :(
I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.
i discourage a protest that tried to infringe upon free speech
Worst winter ever :(
Hahaha aww Noo I love Belfast! One of my favourite cities hands down
Comic sans to seal the deal. Love it.
Excellent analysis!
> make sure you register the claim against them and hit their credit score how does one do this?
Sex lesson for a 28 year old oh god, but I see the point you’re tryin make and I’ll try it! 
his talk show is pretty great
Problem is, it is Bantam and younger. I can teach breakouts easy enough and I don't need a panicked D zone to do it.
Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :(
In case you're wondering, Nintendo does put a bittering agent in their Switch cartridges...and it tastes horrible. 
Somebody reverse this please I would be so happy.
Didn't really help who the Master is but [NAME] will lose his damn mind. We video game worlds now.
Not what this sub is for and this doesn't make you look like a good person but ok
ISU was missing players and had to choke that game away pretty hard in order to lose
Omg yes feels like being new born.
Wish my life was this easy :’) Lets just hope she didn’t kill you
Literally everywhere. There's nothing especially Texan about any of this. I heard all of this in freaking SCONSIN.
Wow Toxicity has been done thousands of times, becoming less and less original, try something new. NEXT! 
"Sports obsessions are basically religion to some people. And those same people make fun of the ""geeks"" at Comic Con... ERROR 404: Logic not found."
I love you
do your own homework
Sounds fun, is it?
I never will understand the reasoning behind puking in a toilet... Perfectly good bucket right there.
Mr. [NAME]! Nooooo!
Sweet. I can get by on beer. Cant sit through a comedy show without an adult beverage of some kind.
This hit way too close to home. I’m suing for emotional damage.
wtf i hate [NAME] now
This. Thank you.
Thank you for explaining! I’m only 31 but now I feel old lol
Burnout takedown. Then when trying to recover in the weekend, a nice chunk of self condemnation.
[NAME] is unbearable. I wish [NAME] had killed her.
Damn that sucks did you get a tip at least?
Thanks for sharing. I'm afraid I will start to squint, this way. Not sure if it's the case. 
Always worth a try. Good luck!
When you dint know Anarchism at all so you think you can be anarchist and capitalist at the same time !
Came on her face and she told you? Wow disrespect. Either she didn't know how you really felt or didn't care. Sorry about your luck
talking about [NAME] i think
You make soap? That's awesome.
Your belief is literally killing children
How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.
holy shit that person is a fucking asshole, talk about a huge red flag for your stepbrother.
Arrow already did break this trend by having a mostly excellent S5, definitely much better than S3 and S4.
I will let my nonexistent child die, thats all right with me!
im shaking and crying right now this is so powerful
Eh, that can happen anywhere. It isn't exclusive to Dallas where that stuff happens. Good luck tho.
Okay that makes more sense to me. Thank you
UGH those two championship games - so many highs and lows then the ultimate high @ the end
They should do it even harder now to spite you
Very cool of /[NAME] to host me for RPGs last night, and especially for stepping up to run a game on short notice. Thanks homie!
Clamato? I see you Canada. And I like it. By the way, we need Wonderbars here in the US. Thanks
Also thank you for the advice.
I never thought to look for this subreddit! Thanks for sharing. I love this show
Can't blame him. As an [NAME], everything I know about American Football came from Eyeshield 21.
Oh no!
I hate people who can't *read* Dx
“I got five on it” for the movie US is decent as well. They made it so creepy.
Here, here. Cheers to starting fresh!
that was an awful open shot....
Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful
Weird that it wasn't included in the article.
This. You need medical attention and they'll be able to put you in touch with resources.
This is amazing. You look like a video game character whose hair texture hasn't loaded in properly.
It was a bad one, and you should feel bad. 
I tend to agree with you. They all have innocent blood on their hands.
What a beautiful response!
That's the point tho, they had lots of talent already, and just a couple of changes at the key spots changed everything 
He looks like a Loony Toons character
Why am I crying rn...
It's great you have a friend with the same struggles as long as you both encourage each other to do better. It can be very comforting.
She’s lovely! Cheers to your lives together
When that intro drops I get so into it and scare my cat
Sadly this is not a new issue for Ukraine. Please take a moment to remember Babi Yar :(
I couldn’t agree with you more!
Because men are weak/stupid enough to let them.
Your age difference is incredibly creepy.
one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment
So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism.
Thank you :) I was starting to seriously wonder if something was majorly wrong with my maternal instincts haha
Best game I've watched from Barcelona since the other 6-1 two years ago!
I saw at least one user on this forum talking badly about [NAME] for missing playing time.
Well all I can say is I'm sorry and May [NAME] open your heart one day.
Oh sorry. Instead of “willfully stupid “ I meant, why do you hate America?
That’s good to hear..I’m so worried I’ll be making the wrong choice by leaving my job I hate soon.
This is so, so great.
I'm sorry [NAME]. I won't do it again.
Can you apply to some kind of help within your university? Sorry this is happening to you.
So you're proudly ignorant. Cool bruh
Makes me glad I'm almost 50, and all this is stuff I will never ever experience, and frankly can hardly fathom.
im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child.
He's great in Silicon Valley too!
I hate Twitter
Why would a poll showing a negative favorability rating go to her head? If anything, people should be worried this will cause her to change her approach.
I am on month 9 post discard. The anxiety has lifted tremendously, and the depression is still looming but not as bad. 
It is a racist nickname because you're literally using the man's race as a means to criticize him.
I'm sorry. I hope he takes the CTJ talk seriously. Fingers crossed for you!
[NAME] i've ever seen, nice to see that money doesn't ruin a good marriage
I'm 14 stone...so probably about 2 stone over weight. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs, but I love food.... 
omg he could soft feint headbutt into GB thank god i wasnt around when that was possible
And then there was the on who grabbed mom’s breast and tried shoving ot onto the ba y’s mouth.
hehe cheeky little guy
This person shouldn't be allowed to drive ever again.
That’s a fair point. Pretend to be a foreigner than? Haha I don’t know. I wish you luck my friend!
It's not a murder or a cringe. Just seems like two friends joking around.
I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
There is no way that happened, dialogue is too coherent to be Scottish.
Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...
I know he lives in Texas and I have his phone number and things like his name and age but nothing else really.
You know more liberals want more gun control than regular [NAME] do, right? 
Idk about that, but if you were being genuine I apologize. I just don't think that is the case in this situation.
Ugh yeah it’s really tiring. I’m in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. 
Plot twist, they're all looking at a mirror because everyone there is a beautiful student
It makes me uncomfortable for anyone to force physical affection on anybody, it doesn’t matter the age. 
Shit out to my little hommies who's parents made them go to school today.
I miss you big strong daddy
True, but I meant he has no holiday themed skin from any of those events and all his skins (volsksya included) are pretty bland sadly...
So uncharacteristic for an INTJ but country music is my favorite genre!
What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it
Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn’t get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
As fun as that sounds, please just call the police.
hahaha. best response I've seen in a few days
I absolutely hate the guy. Can't stand him. But we live in country with laws and he broke none. I think lynch mobs are more gross
Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers
I’ll just take this as an apology and bid you farewell AM x
Hey, take that grade with all the pride you can muster--no shame in being happy for an accomplishment! Congratulations!!
Agreed. 52k isn’t a high paying job, it’s average. He probably is just irresponsible with his money. 
I don’t set an alarm I naturally wake around 4am. Love my mornings.
Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
I flew off the handle and that's my bad.
Especially mean! I’m with you. I like the funny posts but people use social media as an excuse to just be horrible people
At least we aren’t getting blown out. And Vegas is hot right now
Wow! Congrats! I am really proud of you. Hopefully you feel better soon. What an awesome momma ♥️
No one is going to create more competition for themselves
To bad for you.
This will pass and you will be stronger because of it
Sweet home alabama No but for real, is that even legal? You should stop having sex with her.
My hospital has this already, I thought everyone did. Can’t get an IV? Tried a crap ton of places? Call the IV team. 
I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
I’m just waiting for the right director to actualize this subversion of our expectations.
[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure.
You would be better off to do some makeup tutorials. Save yourself the headache of dealing with hormones that you don't actually need.
Thank you [NAME]!
Being bullied is what taught me I wasn't wanted anywhere.
> but to say that it will fuck up your mind is simply ignorant lolol k.
Good luck. :)
I'd love to have [NAME] on our team....
Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup. 😫
This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
Not a perfect game with the error
One wrong kick can end oh so horribly
Hey [NAME]! **TRY DRAWING TWO CARDS NOW, YOU STUPID FUCKING BASTARD!!**
So true, their track record isn't great. Feels like you can only play her in limited ways or die though.
What a beautiful sight that was to behold. Glad I was able to attend a couple of great [NAME] performances. “K” signs everyone
Yes, the Raptors need to stop committing dumb fouls.
It's hard to be good to yourself.
Bless them!
You're definitly an asshole, or a troll. Maybe both.
That was helpful to hear, thanks for your response! 
Let's keep making that trade with different teams until we have all 32 picks in the 6th round one year Sorry, I'll go back to my NHL19
Your husband isn’t at all worried about your reputation since he’s the one who spread the lie. Something to think about
Happy cake day, just in case
If you think not actively going out your way to insult people constitutes hiding your sexuality I don’t know what to tell you.
They’re disgusting people inside and out
I'm more than sure we [NAME] lovers feel the same way, her outfits are awful
I’m still using a laptop from 2008, and until last month I was using a phone from 2013. Actually felt bad upgrading the phone.
Hey congrats!! That's amazing, you've done such amazing progress! Hope you have a great day :)
I’m hoping so. I either make peace with it or I decide to move on
I think Limmy's Show is really hit and miss. Some sketches are funny, others are just poor.
oh [NAME] this is horrible
I love the fsct [NAME] liked this. [NAME] can suck it.
Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles. 
Gods, what a loser.
**<3 I Love You <3** Welcome Home !!
That such a sad flop [NAME]
thank you man
Whoa this is really creepy
Yeah, somebody needs to seek counseling immediately. 
Even if you were, all good my dude! Shouldn't comment on something too quickly lol
Fox News devoted 42 seconds on [NAME], wow.
Burn it!
Yep, regardless how people feel about this benign ad, it has generated 6.9 million views and countless posts. It's a resounding success.
Hipsters love tapes tho.
don’t you do it!!
Oh dang I hadn’t even looked at her face!
Just wait until you're 36 and in a solid career so you can marry a used-up foid who only wants you for your betabux, bro.
Would be really interesting to see how an FMT from a 20 year old would play out in the gut of 60 year old, or vice versa. 
i meant that either one has no scientific backing and was just made by random people, knowing how much people love lables
The cynic in me is pretty sure they don't really do any of that.
Don't date broke/jobless women. I have a job and I always offer to pay the bill or split.
I'm scared because we don't really have any isolation scorers right now.
I like that one that goes “Shield me from sorrow, Fear of tomorrow”
Where are [NAME] and [NAME]??? Time to kick some butts!
wow...u wanna say u were never toxic and u never rage okay if u can t do what I asked just go away ok???
I was expecting the surprise birthday, not seen this twist on the sister before. 
I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.
I'm sorry, when did a subreddit become a sacred institution? That's a false equivalency.
Don’t be silly. Fiat on/off ramps will always be centralized.
I can't even be mad that you scored a goal with your face.
Happy Birthday [NAME]!
"FUCK OFF THAT""S A PEN"
Pickeks are nice idk how many calories I eat day to day lol
Yeah, they have uniforms and everything. It’s really great.
Yum, I love a little pigeon mixed with my grain.
"""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
haha I'm realizing now that's what they meant. I'm just a salty liberal nurse lmao.
Maybe he thought they meant HOKEY!!!! Like “the hokey pokey”. Lol
Same, nights are by far the hardest. My STBX and I are living together until June and it nights suck. 
the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo
Thats not mold
Kill all humans
Dude alcohol is literally poison and talking about tryna self medicate?
How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
I'm so glad Mercy's have to actually try now.
Ireland has only ever had far right or centre right governments in charge lol
You're right. Lets see what Fox News Analyst Lt. Col. [NAME] has to say about Fox
Stick around! Would love your input / POV!
Are you being stupid again?
Poor [NAME] doesn't deserve that!
my fiancé enjoys all the aspie things I do and thinks they're cute. I don't understand why, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
Thanks for the lead. Ordered.
it’s just a nice gesture. don’t make it so deep lol
Yes congratulations that was the joke.
Oh no! Poor dude!
No, we should increase border security because we have an absurd number of people crossing illegally.
I hope they bring him back. Last year was awesome
“What a bummer. He ded. I look at sky. Maybe bird make me happy.”
Im so glad I grew up killing infants at hospitals instead of being on my nokia
**LOVE TO HEAR IT B**
Despite how much the Liberals and NDP apparently hate each other they really do work well together.
My name is [NAME]. You killed my father, prepare to die.
I really hope your marriage is healed and can become stronger than ever.
I wish this had sound so I could hear the crowd roaring in the background. This is so wholesome. Look how excited he gets.
What a legend
You didn't deserve to win after drafting [NAME] in the 2nd
Agree, I avoid of the ones that do, pre-ordering any AAA is a no no now as well.
I know! If it's going to be that cold I want snow. I think there's a chance next weekend
Its ridiculous.
Print outs?!?!?! You tree killing monster!!!!
That government was not democratically elected. But you knew that already.
I love [NAME], but we have better characters to trade for him. Leave [NAME] alone. 
“Touch me again and I’ll kill you.” I’m low key blown away that The Last Boy Scout even *made* it to Australia.
Do I wish people with face tattoos wouldn't be judged? Hell yes! But I'm not ignorant or Delusional enough to believe this.
Any more comments calling me SWERF for caring about sex workers will be blocked and reported I s2g
Yeah I've been finding it so hard to not eat everything in sight since Christmas. I'm still staying under my TDEE, but I feel nasty. 
Which sucks, because it's a *bitch* to find replacements for those.
So excited for the mauve album
Hi, female prostitute for sex work here. Can you not with this angry and condescending attitude? Not good camaraderie, comrade.
Hey, it's working again! Somebody at YouTube must have given the server a whack, because suddenly the recommendations are making sense. I wonder what happened today.
I hope you both enjoy it!
Lol, I love you you drunk bastard!! Now CHUG!! 
Believe you me. TLJ is much, much worse.
Except it's the NFL an he can say fuck it an demand more money at anytime and I wouldn't put it past him.
Don't forget to snack constantly to keep your metabolism up! /s
thats messed up...thats why i dont like reddit as much
Take an updoot for making me smirk and smile. It might be immature, but it's hilarious.
"If by ""better"", you mean ""more fun"", then I'd go with the second one. <smile>"
[NAME] for sure. I really hope we don’t lose [NAME] though. He’s basically our ace for the moment.
This hurts my brain
This has to be my favorite part of this article. WHAT DOES HE MEAN!?!?!
I’m really glad to read that ex-spouses are friends after. Good for you all!
Sorry for your loss. My bestfriend is turning 13 soon and I'm trying to cherish every minute we still have.
Probably because its likely, unfortunately. The question is what happens next for people that are obsolete.
Ah yes, consent is when they awkwardly laugh off an unsolicited sexual encounter!
Most FBI agents never fire their weapons and spend more time looking at excel sheets, lol
Fun fact: you can stop this by removing the prostate that would be epic
I appreciate this reference very much
This is horrifying
he did alledge collusion on the part of the owners and GMs against the players. this guy colludes.
I'm still worried about [NAME] though :(
Awkwardly remembering all of those promises I made mid-panic attack...
You can humanize and normalize everything.
Been getting this same feeling these days.. idk what it is I just have no drive anymore maybe once the cwl comes back it’ll help
Sorry! Yes you are right about the exact name. My brain confused it with the similarity titled cat toy :-p
That hug at the end was like a you’re too precious and innocent for this world”
Yeah, I’d definitely wanna be baked for that
I completely agree, and I love Space Jame. But Back in Action was just amazing and incredibly satirical and witty.
Everything is cool when no one gets hurt.. But as soon as something bad happens, we all scream idiots... Why...?
My opinion is that this person's opinion is stupid, fallacious, and bad.
I’ve never heard of their football team, must be fake news /s
Escape and after some time then die, this is a pretty bad advice so just don't do it
it really sucks how absolutely fucked some of us got genetically in the chest department
You’re welcome!
I wish him good luck trying to get the video back but his chances are quite low. It's one man versus a corporate empire.
Unless the government steps in and does something stupid
Right? It was frustrating (and concerning) that he used such bad reasoning when his job is to curb phishing :/
This is a good change. I've heard too many sad stories on Tinder about this sort of thing, looking for a way out. 
I hate this arm swing thing. Either try to sync up or just stop doing it.
Thank you a lot! Btw that user name tho 😆
Wow this is pretty interesting. We should have a thread about what's it like to grow up in a polygamous household
Wow. This would suck
[NAME] I’m so sorry sweety
I like the name mummied the best so far
You only saw one piece of luggage. I’m not a fan of overly criticizing the things we don’t see.
Absolutely. It's exhausting.
"""they can't come through the port"" He's obviously never seen The Wire"
What? The non-vegan burger air particles have clearly infiltrated the once-pure cardboard. It is absolutely NOT vegan >:(
Most of us think it’s just a conditioning thing right now, but we don’t really know
Suck really hard and hope it ends soon? And don't swallow!!! Bleck - sex is so much better with a woman.
I love flying out of Midway because I feel like I have never waited more than 10 minutes for security. I love the lines at Midway.
Yeah, I’m going to do my best to avoid a fight. She’d probably kill me. 
"Thank you. Apparently simply stating ""it's from a comic called ""supply side Jesus"" wasn't pedantic enough for that guy."
Gotta love trailing for 59+ minutes
And you get a gold! and you get a gold!! and you get a gold!!!
> Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**” FTFY. Sadly.
The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. 
And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME].
Great subterfuge guys
Keep it going. Love your hot takes on this sub.
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
Totally. I loved when she used air quotes for the word “fiancé.”
This is gross and sweet at the same time. Great parenting.
Just eat your goddamn vegetables, [NAME]!
This would, honestly, imo, be a better response than what we've gotten so far. 
Thanks. I though it was fooling a penquin.
Oh okay. Thanks.
> Every billionaire is a policy failure Damn right!
Looks good!
They live was a great film.
Ah the ol' cucked boyo. Whatever after what I've seen you won't change my mind buddy, that's for sure.
you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.
good point I’ll keep that in mind
Fuck that. Anyone who makes a career out of spreading bullshit to morons is worthless trash.
I told you, I don't like ethnic food!
I don’t understand why this is a problem? Each of you just plate up your own food and then eat together.
This is the sweetest thing ever, im gonna steal it and use it on my fiance
That IS crazy!
So you're saying the penalty for DUI is the same as texting and driving? Because that's what I've been saying it isn't true.
There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up. It's not financially feasible.
It'd be a real shame if someone killed it and stole its soul.
I wish my mom was catgirl savvy.
Liverpool FC and Jacksonville Jaguars (Sorry, my kids were born here)
Alright thanks to all. I will tr it with more wards the next time and boots and penetration. Thx for your support!
[NAME] said it best. Un-fuckin-believable bro
The Imperial is the best gay bar in Sydney. PERIOD.
I. AM. AWARE. That doesn't make it cool and good for him to race bait.
Damn. Your bed must stink
You're a brave man for trying claw, I tried it for a week and eventually got pissed and bought an elite controller. Paddles for days!
I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.
You da best thanks
Sorry you are having such trouble.
Thanks, I'll have a look and see what they offer
Your amazing too!
[NAME] is a gem and I love him but he should really be a DH somewhere
>just something motor**sport** fans tell themselves to avoid admitting it’s not really a **sport**. Errr.
I'm so glad to hear that! Good luck rebuilding yourself.
Yes you should tell them and report him to the police for dating someone underage and giving her cigarettes.
The problem is that people cannot differentiate between a necessary and a sufficient condition.
May your test be negative and your New Year's be happy!
I can’t call anyone Daddy. Not even my Dad. It just feels weird and creepy and I’m not 4.
“I hate rich people” - people using website made by rich person on a device made by a rich person.
It's just sad; she was just nice and normal before she messed with her looks
It's a shame cause I spent countless hours squading up on BF1, then played the BF5 beta with high expectations only to be very let down.
Feeling the hatred towards that person I get. Actually running them off the road and holding them at gunpoint? No way. No way to justify that.
Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p
Hell's Kitchen. I bet that man could make [NAME] cry.
Yeah because what we should do is continue to be an absolute embarrassment.
Where did you hear this? Sorry I never heard of this and I'm kinda interested now
Which is fair. But they're not respecting you.
You are absolutely stunning and you’re a triple threat. Black is beautiful! And you’re intelligent and very pretty.
When I was her age I had 3 jobs... oh you have like 18... get off my lawn!
No telling I know is not eat it, I like eggs and I like cottage cheese but yuck no they can’t touch!
Good, hope he actually takes that to heart!
Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money.
This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
I’m afraid I just blue myself
Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
The EU delusion:why a utopian project was always doomed to failure.
For what it's worth, I hope you have a great year anyway.
Lots of them are in really beautiful unique buildings. The one in folkestone in particular is pretty amazing.
That's not what I've heard ;)
I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
I don’t go out that way much but even [NAME] is killer if it’s slippy out.
You should be required to be 25+ if you want the government to acknowledge your marriage. So stupid.
Midnight has been 4/4 pro league teams they have played so far, so I wouldn't be too sure they're gonna be bottom feeders
This team was nowhere near legendary, filled with legends sure, but incredibly disappointing.
That is genius.
Lol, I’m surprised more people didn’t catch that. Thanks for the med check! 
While out at the beach for a weekend for her birthday. There was no final straw, I just wanted to. 
Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
Then I disagree that being a cog in someone’s machine is reason to be resentful.
The furry community loves it.
Hahaha, that's true for all their series.
I'm not telling them, I was just saying that the person who knew them irl said they were a she. That is all
"The fact that this podcast isn't called ""Z-Targeting Dio's Balls"" disappoints me greatly."
"If [NAME] had served all fast food buffet to a football team Reddit would be circlejerking ""So down to earth and amazing!!1"""
ahhh yes, that post from 2 years ago with 39 upvotes, remember it like it was yesterday. 
Spoiler: I think they mean me, even though I would hope that is literally the opposite of what my comments have been doing. 
Well who knows what valve thinks. I don’t like Lyrical and Maut either.
You don’t understand it because it’s insanely dumb, as the vid demonstrates.
Thanks, I wouldn't have noticed the car without it.
Dammit, I thought I put it at the bottom. Sorry.
Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
No? This is literally saying that a wall would be useless, unless you also wanna build 40-50 feet beneath the ground.
I love how you are a individual just trying to be yourself. I always say sexuality is the least interesting things about yourself.
okay im interested in joining the bare hands hunting posse
I know and I think that's a lot more impressive/interesting. :)
I get all the deja smells and it's terrible.
None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
Sweet thanks for the update. I hope the kitty finds a good home
I'd just feel less out of place, I guess. My SA makes me feel like I'm so behind my peers in terms of a social life
And the sad part is this goes on for decades and decades grrrrrrr
Being compared to [NAME] is a compliment because he’s funnier than I’ll ever be soooo
"Nevertheless, it amuses me that they mis-spelled ""literally"", and *only* ""literally""."
Even if you were a woman, your personality is so vile and yuck I would happily do 20 years in prison for murdering you.
Thanks everybody!
So do I, but I don’t want them to be associated with government espionage and other shady shit either.
[NAME] was an awesome Chief. Wish we would've seen more of him being a badass.
Same with [NAME]. I was even disappointed Parks and Rec had newt gingrich on for a cameo.
[NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP.
That is really dumb. If you have a crime committed against you, you have a civic responsibility to report it. We need those stats. 
This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
Thanks, I hope I can get through it too. Good luck with your futile attempts to sleep :p
Ya I sent one not too long ago.. I'll wait till my next try. Also I learned Sens a very crap selection for shot glasses.
Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult
"Sorry, ""semi"". Happy?"
From one eating disorder to another. That's not recovery that's just sad.
Idk why anyone would think PMing abusive messages is above the law on reddit.
My condolences.
This isn’t even them not getting it. They just misread it as a whole! Why bro lmao
RDR singleplayer, not whatever the fuck that online is
This is a good map though.... Just needs some minor QOL tweaks.
Thanks for finding out! That's cool
Congratulations!! Colorado is an amazing place! I just moved away a year ago and miss it terribly :) Best of luck to you!
> Portland seems awesome from the outside, not so much once you're there. big fax here folks
I'm terrible sorry, /u/bookluvr83, but I'm afraid I must join up with the giving-you-crap-for-not-liking-brownies bandwagon. ^kidding ^^^kinda
Love [NAME]! MAGA and [NAME]! [NAME]! But this is not helping....
Bore off, you pearl-clutching, centerist coward. 
Don’t worry; I’m sure your dad will come back from the store any day now.
I cringe when I see [NAME] playing while we’re stuck with sensitive old [NAME].
I don't know, I was to busy getting annoyed by [NAME] whiny entitlement to dislike [NAME]
"I disagree with everything after ""job."" "
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE RUDY
Then you'll be arrested, play stupid games win stupid prizes.
Mate it's been nice the last couple weeks. You're gonna die when a stormy period arrives.
>I don't care either way. Good. Then stop making asinine comments on the matter.
For art? I think it's kind of silly, but it's also fun. Let people live :P
She must hate her father.
And if that's the case then there is no helping him. It sucks that those people can't be helped
me too thanks
Sold out. Sorry my dude!
i love casual racism
Yes for sure! Please let me know how your job venture goes! :) would love to hear your experience.
“I’ll never step foot in a gym again”
You're a hero.
Man I hate kids
Omg [NAME]! One of my favorite bb players
You called yourself a Met fan. THAT is embarrassing. Edit: called themselves a Met fan and didn’t know who [NAME] was AMD disrespected him.
I just finished rewatching the film and let me tell you. [NAME] is a legend.
Am yisrael chai is a phrase we should never take for granted.
Fair enough.
The right time would have been never being there in the first place
I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one
I’m sorry on behalf of all the idiot guys. They didn’t take my class. How Not to be Creepy 101.
I can’t stand anything about her yet. Nothing.
My [NAME] accuses me of cheating all the time too when I’ve been nothing but loyal. Makes me wonder if she was cheating on me too...
Stuff like this makes me worry a little less about the future generations.
Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
Especially that “Australia ain’t gonna cop it” ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder.
Yes, I remember when I said that. Thanks for the reminder! 
Great show honestly
I’m sorry about your pup. At least between the two of them she won’t be neglected? I just feel badly for you.
Watching girly tv shows. Stuff like gossip girl, pretty little liars, and gilmore girls are all a guilty pleasure
Possible sad tyre
Amen, block all immigration.
Truly a blessed day for you! Shine on!
Just because she was watching, doesn’t mean she was into it.
Funny how reddit works
Haha username checks out, but I thank you all xx
Nah. Been over it pretty much since [NAME] said the Vikings did it too. Pretty hard to be mad when we were just as guilty.
Honestly, I love hearing about stories like this - like the multitude of Skyrim and Oblivion mod developers who eventually got hired by studios due to their work.
Most traffic violations are victimless crimes and fining people for them is wrong.
Yeah, thank him for helping support this legislation
this literally made me sick to my stomach
He believed Ireland had a right to exist, he just didn’t believe in the way the IRA(1919-1921) went about their business. 
Avoid. Without a contract he can kick you out at short notice any time And when you pay a deposit make sure it's protected.
Really disappointed it's not even coming digitally on Vita outside of Japan.
This is horrific
Now let's sit down, relax, and have a nice cool glass of turnip juice.
Two problems: It's not a newsworthy story. You'd get sued for defamation.
Yeah it’s ridiculous. I mean I’m crying about the model but I still spent the money lol
Yes i hope things go well for them
I un-ironically love that song
"My bad. I typo'd. It should have said ""how""."
Damn didn’t see it sorry
I should have known better, its obviously not a juul. I was just happy to see Oliver Tree tbh 
Yup, thanks, I've got someone coming this week - good idea
Let's hope you've got the self control to not binge :) I know I didn't
Here, you are among friends. I wish we all could meet you in real life and surround you with smiles and hugs. Are you in Utah? 
Yeah thankfully I live in mass where it’s legal here too lol
This fuck needs to sthaaaaap
It's got home made bread pudding so therefore the rest has to be good!
[NAME] yer fucked.
[NAME] “Good! It’s such a distraction to the team!”
My wife is a rams fan. I don’t like them, but I think I like them more than the patriots lol
So you're a liar.
A 31 one year old woman hitting on a 21 year man is just as grossm
These are some of the most talented marbles I've ever had the honor and privilege of watching.
YEAH, YOU MOTHERFUCKER
Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
PNW represent! Southern Oregon. Our non-mono scene is....pretty sparse.
Thanks for the help but just went for the delete all option somehow still kept my ranks so idk what the fuck that all was evennabout
Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. 
"Was totally expecting this to end with ""and then the game crashed"" lol"
Something like Chariot will occur again but all electric and highly autonomous. Something I wish [NAME] could do right now.
i dream of making $7k
This would have been a perfect test of those Katyushua rocket water dispensers.
Wow! You've put my relationship in words I couldn't think of.
The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man
I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
they should just stop broadcasting road games
We don't do that here
Well good luck! Hoping to see you in my diamond games soon. Psn is LokleLad if you ever wanna stack
I <3 you!
Also hate the little 2 wheeled zapper
Love both sports, but this is what annoys me about Boxing when compared to MMA. If this was the UFC this fight would have happened years ago
Sorry actually [NAME] runs this one. [NAME] runs the daily wire. Also I didn’t see anywhere in there where she said that
I don't know you, but I am so proud of you. Hugs.
Holy crap, that movie was bad.
It's such a relieving feeling to know you're finally gone. You never have to go back. You are so strong you got this!!
[NAME] man hope your luck changes soon. I’m sure they’ll patch it up in the future
America.... I have done goofed!
Same. Body hair (on my own body..I don't care what anybody else does with THEIR body hair) grosses me the fuck out.
More like I was raised in Asia but go off. I’m not gonna bother arguing with trumpie lmao.
Hi, [NAME]! I am here to offer you a robot hug, and to wish you the best day of your life! -HappyFriendlyBot
good cause i don’t want it!! haha.
I love him even though the newest season of t@gged kinda sucked.
It's funny to imagine that they're calling [NAME], a married man, an incel.
She's so cute! Give her all the huggles
That hop/shuffle is scary
Thanks, that's what I was looking for! 
I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
Na. Rediting my post. Sorry for the ignorance.
I'm glad you're feeling better! Keep smiling :)
Please no.
I hope so. Either [NAME] or [NAME] deserve it the most
Two goals that are directly the fault of the our defense? I feel bad for [NAME]
He drives to the basket like [NAME] used to. And can shoot the 3. And he's super clutch. Love the dude
Meanwhile in western society grown-ass adults will leave their McDonald's trash scattered all over the place just feet away from the bin.
Well, it is generating them. It has a vector space (latent space) from which you can pick out a face.
ok, so there are no checks client side, thanks for the information and all the best luck on the project!
When you look back at your picks and realize you’re laying pretty much entirely chalk Tenn -8 Bowling Green -4 Akron -1 NC STATE -1.5 Duke -21 MSU This should go well lol
Who had sent him threatening notes last week.
Excellent game tonight, let's get a new win streak going on this road trip!
Born and raised in New Britain. Love these sodas.
I walked 500 miles and then I walked 500 more, you can’t relate to my pain 😤
Not really, more of a toxic poverty problem. Women get overworked too.
Yeah, all the stun cannonballs are horrible. 
Thanks ? Lol I'm no internet warrior but that crossed the line. I also DM the video to [NAME]. The girl deserves love
oh got it😂😂😂😂
They're cowards.
this was hard to watch but i’d take it over the grungy redhead talking about her full tummy 🤮
Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.
We cant even get sexually assaulted without them claiming we're gross fetishists
I find it boring and, at times, incredibly annoying in all of the games. It completely lost its appeal somewhere around Black Flag.
I’m not sure what to make of any of this but stay strong, friend. You’ll get through this eventually!
This is me today, I have to do a 1-2 MINUTE presentation and I’m freaking out about it
that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
A girl that ugly only liking me isn't a compliment its an insult and it shows [NAME] hates me
You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person.
So glad you are safe. It looks like icy conditions, too, so that is great that you were able to avoid this.
It's near Brooklyn. Very woodsy, couple nice little antique shops. Most definitely the middle of nowhere.
You know, you’re right, she didn’t take the opportunity as seriously as she should have it seems
I think I met you. Sorry if I was a bit standoffish.
Wow, way to disregard history completely.
Yep, famous German basketball player. 7’ tall. 
Confronting people with footage from slaughter houses is a horrible thing to do in my opinion.
Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
Well that’s dumb. The question is about this sub.
"Love how she was able to find a 'rabbi' from N anti-Semitic group to ""prove"" her defense of anti-Semitism. Just fantastic. /s"
Hi, I just fix it, I just had to clear the cookies
This face will not age well.
Nope. Sadly early 30s
Yes, ~~jack~~ jake will be great too! Love the audio mixer with the old Spiderman soundtracks...looks very well produced...
I don't know what she is talking about. Therefore i will say that she is DEFINITELY WRONG AND SHOULD SHUT UP! /s
Haaaa! That's awesome! Sounds like my town, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
Cool Thanks very much !
THANK you. They don’t even know how they sound
...and show some respect to her parents!
Happy New year!
Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background.
YouTube is also fantastic for this stuff too.
Okay please share your biggest mistake and let me decide if I fail to see how that could happen
It would honestly make sense for her track record and she’s releasing her new song and it’s a plastic runway and she made of plastic
[NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off.
"""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s"
Wait. Is this a parenting book with a typo? Because this seems to be a great approach to use with a toddler.
1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
Where's my thank you for that flair, hm? This is theft.
Throwing the book to see what sticks you think?
> [NAME] HAHAHAHSHSHAJSHA
Love the idea for the [NAME] skin but I think it might be too hard :/
Nah, this sub is for well put together unpopular opinions. This is too low effort.
Glad things came out alright for you...
Thank you, what kind of lawyer would be best in this case?
I love that smile of his!!!!
That actually sounds pretty bloody hilarious. Maybe I'll work that into one of my one-shots.
Holy shit was that the one guy that supported remain? I didn't know we had a celebrity on this board.
"[NAME]: ""WTF, it's just a prank bro!"""
Awesome! You got this!
Moose is pretty underwhelming tonight, I miss JV
Ikr. Who the hell goes to Greggs for *pizza*?
A lovely bronze age mud hut, it's a British tradition.
Wow talk about strength!
Sad for the people who contracted measles. Angry at the parents who didn't vaccinate their kids against measles.
My man.
This comment is basically 10 words of “I didn’t read the article!! But boom, I’m edgy af”
Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal.
It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
"You know he was too distracted by ""boobies"" on his teen wife to care about the realistic possible outcomes of rushing into marriage with a teen. "
Yeah that makes a lot of sense and I'm glad you looked passed all the negativity
Yessir. And I live in Dallas. Stop being salty freefreebradshaw.
Yea just went yesterday and the woodhaven area didn’t seem too bad. Seems very country for being only 25min from downtown.
Keep pushing. You’ll come out of this stronger I promise
I just gave you a quote direct from the current finance minister regarding the supply. Get real, man.
I actually choose to teach an extra class so I can avoid lunch duty. I hate it.
Thanks for clearing that up
I don't just cringe, I feel literal embarrassment for anyone who has watched it.
My favorite thing about this is that OP doesn’t clarify which item he’s so excited about.
Sorry, your diverse, inclusive baby was aborted.
Insurance covers stupidity, so maybe they'd cover it? 
About as far as I got too, what a rude condescending wanker he is. 
yeah guys, stop complaining about violent mobs and join one!
Ha! I like that one.
Ah, I see. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to make contact. Thanks for the info!
Happy Cake Day you barefoot bitch!
Wouldn’t have looked as cool.
I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
Are you implying that I can not determine guilt by seeing a person's skin color and tense smile, you fucking racist?
[NAME] screaming that to [NAME] was so funny to me
I'm sorry but [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are my favs this year (and I hated [NAME] in her Season).
[NAME] are not the best at being subtle about being incels...
Fucking and being a boy
I completely agree, I just think there is more of a chance of Clowney getting tagged than [NAME] getting tagged a second time.
Thank you! Yeah, she won't take bs.
my parents got engaged in the courtyard of [NAME] back in the 70s
Not really the point I'm making, but thanks.
Why? He was always brilliant. It was such a shame he lost out to [NAME]. Things would have been very different today...
I'm only saying it because I'm jealous :(
thanks guys appreciate the clarifications!
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
aw too bad im 6.5k, you arent extremely good. 
Heh I love this.
That guy was beyond cringe, it was creepy
When has the Alt-Right ever been working class? Its always the richest white guys who are horribly socially inept.
Tell her to stop being so fat, then. Edit: /s
I do! (Sorry this comment just showed up for some reason)
I dont think [NAME] is a fun drunk type of dude.
Errr, i didn't want to risk get in trouble with the discipline master, especially since we weren't on good terms at that point in time
Watch your language, thanks bud
They love me!
Yea it's a tricky one, we need more buttons!! 
Some seriously embarrassingly bad fan fiction too
Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.
Yeah, series of holes like that make me uncomfortable and this picture has popped up in my head too many times since I first saw it. 
At the discretion of NI, which is currently lacking any Assembly or proper representation. Good luck with that.
No you basically throwing him under the bus by posting him here.... fake natty suspicion 100%
>ribs My condolences on your loss.
Nope. I’m not wrong. Flipper superficially inflate housing prices without substantively contributing to their value.
I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.
Sexual frustration.
Thanks hehe hit me up on there sometime!
Incredible how you can... SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME!!!
"Damn I got a notif from a (very cute) friend saying ""no u"" on Discord right before I saw this"
Double doink Love it
When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...
Omg I want this dog ❤️❤️❤️
You know he meant Golden Gardens. You are not discussing this in good faith.
Same. You run a progressive or I will not vote
Same, hopefully it’s there in 15 years so people have the opportunity to look at it and pick a different brand.
Glad you got to see a good one!
"Too lazy to type out ""him/her"" 3x. That and I don't give a fuck."
I HATE that song...I did not vote for it. A few of my songs I liked went at around 60-70
9 to 4. That's pretty sorry.
Sorry, What I meant to say was if it had been worded differently it wouldn't have the same effect. 
He’s my #1 pick for HC. Love this guy!
Oh [NAME] why does he have to drag green day into this
Props to YOU for being so appreciative, sir. :) You don't often see it. Good luck out there!
I’m tired from working hard and I want someone to snuggle me to sleep
Point is, you’ll have to come clean. Sooner rather than later. And if she loves you, she can forgive you. 
Thank you for your valuable contribution to the discussion
"So is liking [NAME] enormous eyebrows ""biological"" too? /s ^I ^think ^her ^eye ^brows ^look ^cool"
Thank you for your advice!
Thanks man. We had a taste of the storm Thursday. In South Central PA, we are all ready for the shit to fall.
I actually don’t mind Sudbury to Nipigon but whole North Ontario sucks overall.
They're just misguided, useful idiots.
Lol that sucks. It's 80.9 in Vegreville, 84.4 at a Costco, or pretty much between 85-89 cents everywhere in Edmonton and area.
I think you overestimate the ability of politicians to rig the vote c.f. May 2017
Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.
I prefer console and most of my friends play cod. I still enjoy gbs every year
How the fuck is that not ticketable.
I know one time I mixed stuff up and posted the slashes instead of the asterisks to italicize. Oops.
You're an idiot
Pls not granny :(
It's a shame they have [NAME] because a Vuc package would be ideal
I am an atheist and the idea of a god makes me disgusted and angry so I prefer not to be religious
And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.
>Cause they almost never hit anything. Very inaccurate. The benefit of fighting against a largely untrained adversary.
Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
How did your consultation go? I would really love to hear what it was like. I'm starting to think about my future consult too.
Interesting, I’m going to have to pay closer attention. Thanks.
Damn don’t sell this
Wow, after the past 2 seasons that seems like it was like 6 years ago.
Hard to follow after reading his post history. Says he is divorced...
I’d choose the kind amateur over the ignorant flamer any day, no matter what rank are they.
I now understand why everybody gets pissed off at these weak ass pump fake fouls.
i do love how absolutely distraught the girls look
I don't even find her that loud or that wild I think he's just no fun.
Easy on the Granville Island gatekeeping amigo. Its absolutely a tourist destination.
[NAME] is great
That's awesome. Hahaha
In what fucking world is this drawing not bad
America can out-lazy your ass any day.
What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
I don’t think you are comprehending what I’m saying.
yes. to the above number i provided :) hope it’s helpful!
It's literally not. I love that people believe it. I'd like to see any info showcasing it.
I refuse to read him any more. Just another [RELIGION] man getting a slap on the hand & a cover up job.
Sadly, I don't even think its that the Chargers aren't prepared its that the Patriots are good at game prep.
The University of Essex was a mistake. They're not even good at sports.
[NAME], loved the story. Personally I don’t think this was petty I think it was quite fair and right. Good job dude.
Happy cocaine on a plate day!
"Now I'm imagining him responding to your dirty talk with an enthusiastic ""yummy!"""
Yeah tis marketing tweet from the melbourne AFLW team about their captain seems like marketing being pushed down my throat. You woke af.
nothing I dont owe anyone any explanation.
I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this
Call ambulance or police for a wellness check but make HER pay the ambulance fees/ callout fees, not OP. it should teach her real fast.
This would be a good thing. I want capitalism to die.
Exciting finish here.
Yall remember that rainbow zebra striped gum that lost its flavor in like 0.0001 seconds
Now all I’m imaging is [NAME] casted in the American pie movies as [NAME]. Thank you for this memory.
This is the most perfect thing I've ever seen. So many layers
This guy - you win.
Wouldn't that be the western sky? Also very beautiful pic, OP.
i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread
Quad turret hopefully
Humiliation on top of arrest!!!
I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour.
I wish there was videos of people like this figuring it out later organically and just feeling dumb lol
And why does he shame women for choosing a beautiful person over an ugly guy lol?
We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.
And then you see some idiots in the street walking with their speakers listening to reggaeton out loud (at least in Spain).
[NAME] literally won the game of baseball that night. Like, go home, we're done, he just won baseball forever.
Sweet summer child
Ah, modern society's obsession with romance for the sake of romance… I hate it.
Was almost hit by some idiot yesterday that drove straight through a red light and into a crossing.
Thanks! I was probably going to look in the Midwest
I'm worried that even in the summer we're not going to have the funds necessary to do that.
Spider Man is pretty awesome.
It would be nearly impossible to get to the point of being immobile/bedbound without someone enabling you hand and foot.
Awesome! I’m a cradle [RELIGION], so really interesting to hear your experience. Thanks for sharing.
ESPN and sports is not a good combination.
First of all how DARE you plague this country with your USELESSNESS you degenerate smh
Best picture of this I’ve seen so far!
DELETE THAT SCREEN SHOT! NOW!!!
That's...kinda...why...i...used...the....phrase.
this is a GANGSTER-ASS revelation!!!!. thanks mr. [NAME]!
I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
My [NAME] and Papa were married 44 years before my Papa died last February. I hope to have a long marriage like them..
Oh fuck off already.
Hahaha thanks. I didnt notice the spelling dammit. Edited now.
thank you it’s just odd it randomly showed up and hasn’t always been there
Well when ever you want to see her check the cahpters she is in :) haha
I've been playing for years and it's still a bitch for me to lay off balls.
Said it all year, I think losing [NAME] hurt this team in more ways than we'll ever know. 
Yeah I guess, still going to try to keep a log of my feelings as a way of venting them and getting them out of my head.
Losing my Origin account? Oh no, how else will I play thousands of other non-shitty EA games now?
I spent the entire time trying not to yell at the TV. [NAME] and [NAME] can fuck right off.
She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
I can be convinced to like any trade right now but it all comes down to the return.
Oh I didn't know. Please give me his P.O. Box address so I can submit them immediately. Cause I am definitely uninterested in blowing out my intestines.
Glad you're rid of me? Pretty obviously breaking the sub rules there.
Stop with this revisionist history we literally just let him go because HE SUCKED
😂😂👸👸👏🙌👏🙌❤❤❤💥💥👑👑💎💎💯💯♀️♀️♀️ Now that's emoji game on point.
Alot more common in NY City.
The Nexus 6 is my favourite phone even though its a few years old but no one knows Moto or Nexus phones so.....
I'm not sure how to post a picture lol. Here's my attempt.
You are unfortunately far and few between.
Feudalism is statism, dumbass.
Hmm ... Vancouver is not on the list? that's interesting ...
Fuck isn't it nice to have a [NAME] on the team?
Not sure what carrier you have but TMobile has a pretty damn good scam call blocker included in their plans.
Lol thank you so much for pointing that out. It’s the “re” on the “tard” cake.
I'll take that on board! I'm a mostly patient person. At least I hope so, lol. Thanks for the advice (:
I was scared of my room and even when I fell asleep in my bed I would sleep walk into my mom's room
Besides, Canada is extremely choosy about the kind of people they allow in.
His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
For 3 months so far. I’m not sure because I never had any successful withdrawals yet.
That fucking Mills charge is FUCKING BULLSHIT
"CREEP FACTOR MIDNIGHT ""virgins gonna be scared"""
You probably can. They're shit at hurling.
Yes, he needs to sit the fuck down, that's all I have to say.
What a horrible person
Looks like the walk of shame. Heading home after a night of partying and to much drinking.
He said this awhile ago. His splits away from coors scares me.
Maybe you were depressed because your place was a mess.
Same thing I thought haha
I like this kid
It's pretty convenient
We need to do something about [NAME] because he's fucking my fantasy team up
Just go to a doctor/dispensary or call them on the phone.
Imagine being born in 1987 and not having been invited to a party since your friend's birthday party in 1999 though :(
OW MY LEG!
Lucky you got a sane dad. Get ready for a world of crazy... just don't get sucked into her toxic world. Good luck.
This man... This man is doing [NAME] work!!
I'm sorry but did anybody else read the first paragraph and get flashbacks to My Immortal? \x45\x62ony [NAME], is that you???
So long, and thanks for all the fish. 
"I have no idea what ""[NAME]"" is. These billion and one denominations are getting kind of ridiculous."
Hurr durr, put well regulated back in the constitution. Ok [NAME] the fucking [NAME].
You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
I like it. It reminds me of Aphex Twin but I also hear modest mouse melodies and rhythms. I'm a fan of both
Good mind, good luck.
iT cAn'T bE sExISt bEcAuSE iT's a mErItocRaCy. -tech bro assholes justifying gender discrimination and systemic sexism
I'm sorry for you, but that pic is in the wrong subreddit.
no your are disrespectful at least i pay my respects
That right hand sent our dad flying across the cage. Lol
How about as a whole we just hate snow
I never said it was irrelevant. I am trying to add on to what the OP had said for potential savings.
The paratrooper theme fits very well with his jump! Keep up the good work.
You'd be stupid not to do this.
Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though
I love this show
Think FARC and Columbia if you're looking for something to compare the Afghan talks to. That's the best that useless war can hope to achieve.
It’s never been good lol
Your hamstering is beyond entertaining. There are tons of posts, but you can't find any?
I eagerly await [NAME] rush meta. >=)
Yeah because streaming services don’t pay their artists well enough
That's hilarious.
Thats the problem you have with this? Mule kick in zombies has exactly what he wants xD
It's Incredible! So glad I could help with this! :D
I dont think self-sources work for TIL.
2018, more disappointment. 
i read your first sentence laughed and stopped reading easily verified basic historical facts are not conjecture genius
Fair enough. That is a form of cuckery I cant approve of.
The comment thread is a hot mess and wouldnt be out of place in 2016. How do things not change....
He looks like a genuinely nice guy. He doesn’t look fat and greasy
Tell that to r/Polygrumps (very *VERY* NSFW) dude. They scare me more than this sub.
Cool story bro
That actually sounds like it would help, I’m glad it worked for you and I hope you eye is ok now 👁💪🏻
Pregnancy test. No matter how old I am, I am still embarrassed. 
He was just trying to sit down I think. Poor guy, doesn’t deserve all this shit from reddit.
In that conversation it was the girl being boring and closed... sometimes it’s not your fault and people feel they’re the ones being awkward
Amazing. And heartbreaking. I'm learning so much from little bits like that.
This sub can be so ridiculously cynical. It's just a pretty picture of a sign!
"""THE SAMPLE SUCKS! THAT TOWN HALL MEETING WASN'T EVEN AS GOOD AS THE TLIC ONE"" "
Please explain how this is stupid
[NAME] doesn't get a vote [NAME]! Get the fuck out of here with this nonsense.
mans got me excited
Grats man. I hit my second live one today coincidentally! Feels good :)
Maybe, idk though. I dont think thats enough to nail him. We need more.
this strikes me hard. I wish i knew my way out of this
I don't think the people who agree with this post fully understand how large a legion is.
I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
I thought this was going to be a fierce, competitive game... how wrong I was.
I just don't like our options in the off season.
Why does [NAME] also steal [NAME] revolutionism
So glad to hear that! you go girl<3
>Also, you realize that both parties largely dabble in identity politics. Oh absolutely! It's a major reason I hate [NAME]. 
This is the funniest shit I've seen all day.
Worth a try to report the bus number, the route and the time to PTV to see if he can get them back. Best of luck!
Congrats on approaching the situation with logic unlike most everyone else
Not really. Also it’s Winnipeg, sorry we don’t have the population of Tokyo...
That is absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much for your help and support.
Everyone knows that the rich have a secret cure for cancer! /s
Hope + Sabres = Mistake Just remember that you love hockey and do your best to enjoy the ride.
Yes! It's hard to believe that some people like warm toilet seats enough to pay for it as a feature.
I actually got one of those, really fucking good tbh
[NAME] seems to be really honest in the meaning of lore. She supports [NAME] from the very beginning.
Lol, ..probably not. But then again, i never wanted to know what blue waffles were and somehow i do. 
I brought my love a cherrrryyyyy....
Not surprising.
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
I wish you to experience exactly the same feelings that I'm experiencing
That weighs heavy on the heart, I’m so sorry for your loss
This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
Omg her fake laugh there. I cringe.
Don't worry, no one agrees with [NAME]! I bet you're doing an amazing job.
Thanks, that's an important point I should have mentioned. 
She looked the wrong way on a one way street. How are you that stupid.
Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.
You've not listened to him.
You should have an AP that respects you ...not just one that wants to use you.
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that’s a terrible idea.
That ruling is such a mess: it gets the *reason* correct, but the Justices were so out of touch that the entire ruling was contradictory to that. 
The ending was awesome
Wow. All that up and down cycling. These people must feel 80 by the time they're 30.
Good call. Run!
I liked the slug :(
Btc is a shite coin
>Federal minimum wage should be closer to $5 That's a horrifying thought.
"""it doesn't count if you're drunk""? Wow.. Imagine that being used as an excuse in other situations."
Y'all just introverted. It's cool to be akward we extroverts, at least smart ones, love you anyway
Screw them. We do what we have to do to get our kids to eat.
Rethink your body! With type 2 diabetes, you can loose your lower limbs thanks to peripheral artery disease!
"""okay honey, either this is gonna fix my back problems or we're calling 911"""
Aw it’s the same user who was scared of breast feeding lmao
Hello! [NAME] is beautiful but I’ve only been once. I never had the whisky so I can’t even argue haha.
Isn't Marquis literally a noble title and not his actual name. I don't think being nobility counts as a fair expectation for the modern youth.
Thank you man whoever you are, this has really helped me. Best of luck to you too
I did not know that, and tbf I did completely neglect my MH between 18-23. Too busy with sex, drugs and alcohol. 
Worst feeling ever
Either of those scenarios make sense. I'm getting antsy I need some positive Steelers news haha.
The great ancap argument lol
Awe poor guy! He still has a sweet face even with the new addition. Glad they were ok.
Whales have excellent hearing. I couldn't imagine how it is hearing loud ass sonar.
This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad
No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.
Yes. Less toxic =/= nontoxic.
I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles
Shhhh, don’t say that, your going to trigger a millennial 
I agree with you! Just wishful thinking from me I guess aha!
Still a bit of redesign & this would look much better.
The intent is to provide the players with a sense of pride and accomplishment...
i started smoking cigars at 30 lol
You need to talk to her openly about this... without shaming her. She’s being open and honest with you. Your turn.
[NAME] has such a weird relationship with his parents. It’s as if he’s 15 years old still.
I have that one! I like it a lot. Despite the name 😂
There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low...
Nope. No joke. Also happy cake day
Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?
I do. but some people love it
Ah yes, the merge from 640 to 40 by papermill. Idiots do this all the time. It really messes up the traffic pattern. 
Fuck, my wife and I spent less than a *fifth* of that. Wow. 
Thank you for phrasing it in a way where I picture [NAME] leaning over a school bus seat to tell me that.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools
I watch almost every Bears game as I am in that market lol
Definitely not a dead human body. He’s probably just a weird dude that has some weird thing in his room that smells terrible.
How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
i'm not that into shower sex tho. like it's fun sometimes, but it takes me so long to get off when i'm wet.
I’m sure you’ve been accosted many times by the cops, or as I call them “[NAME] fash squad” !!!
The most my dad did to help with the housework in 35+ years of their marriage was to lift his legs while mum vacuums around the couch
Forthwith this group will remain unnamed, verily so that we might avoid bringing ire upon ourselves for a simple observation.
Thank you for your response!
Black Mirror is great.
What’s wrong with this
Adding a few projectile characters only made the game better, not worse. Bars can go though.
I hope you’re doing well with RCIA! So sorry for your loss. Praying for you, your family, and your daughter ♥️
Now I really hope he spends a few days meditating on music and then gets back to us on his insights regarding Giant Steps by [NAME].
> fooled into believing herself an interesting character Uh.. that isn't how movies work.
That would be greatly appreciated.
I’m sure if it’s crusty there’s some flavor.
“[NAME], have we got an offer for you!”
The lil dance he does after is amazing too
He's a sexist piece of shit regardless so
How dare you disparage a 3D printed JV riding a goddamn raptor
Word. I have 0 of these in my life. I miss my INTJ ex brother-in-law haha.
But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
Sucks that [NAME] was a straight positive in important minutes and hasn’t seen the floor since..
Of course it was a huge hit for him. I hate people
I'm sorry OP but this is all on you. Your parents played you like a $4000 fiddle.
My son told me he hates me
> busy blasting stuff with plasma Sound like more fun.
So it’s somehow weird or different to make a child/student pick up their (there) own mess as part of the lesson?
Glad you had fun! Your gf sounds like a keeper!
That's the best thing about free will, you don't need an excuse.
Booty matters MUCH more in my opinion
Hello. We have removed your comment for shaming. Thanks [NAME]
I honestly think he’s making fun of you
Don't use gay as an insult.
Peering into the void Out of the abyss Something stirs Terrible secrets _____ Hope is lost Once it wakes [NAME] is dead
This makes me smile
This is why we love Football!!!
But why? I have enough awkward moments in my life. I just want to see comedy when I watch a show labeled as one.
I went to the exhibit in Chicago some years ago. It’s absolutely stunning
With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
That's great to hear! I had no idea we actually helped so many people with just a dumb sign and some cookies.
that's weird... playing Smash Ultimate usually just makes me feel like drinking.
I don't think you've ever seen the dsm. If you knowingly do something stupid you don't deserve anything but what you get
I love the bus so much.
Not probable, I study in the best university in my country, I don't want to stop at all
Ehhh he got played so hard on the [NAME] vs [NAME] situation in 2017. Lost credibility after that for me
Yes, please do. I'd appreciate any help.
FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.
If we hurry, we can still catch the heroin craze! 
Funny enough OP is a gooner
I miss it but it was op
Its worth it for the other big character they bring in.
Don't you know? We have to just shut up and put our heads down until they decide!
They're really cute but I'd never in a million years own one because they literally smell like week-old pissed on rugs.
You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don’t react to facts maybe they’ll react to wounded pride.
Thank you and I try to keep our contact at a minimum.
Yeah, sorry about that. I see it in so many post I thought it was almost a custom to do so.
"""There's always a bigger fuckup."""
The fucking worst game in the world.
Oh she dead
Haha didn’t even notice. It’s staying.
It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.
Oh dear. Ive tried to forget that. Lmao If some one brings this up, i just remind them we are also the toilet water town. Lol
This scene was priceless! Trash TV gold.
Sorry, but isn't this a little too obvious? As the old saying, the early bird catches the worm.
Lol this never gets old
An ugly fuk
Good lord [NAME], just don’t buy it
dae [NAME] IS MOMMY FUCK MY ASS WITH A BACKHOE MOTHER YES GAWD *tongue pop* WHAT A TALENTED ACTRESS BUT ALSO PARENTAL FIGURE
It's normal, don't worry too much about it.
"That ""Duff City"" belt is an amazing touch"
FUCKACTIVISION THEY RUIN EVERYTHING
Boring way to get it and unfair with the rest of the pkayers
"""Welcome to the hydraulic press channel.."""
No lol it's just the sub's flair. Also I was joking about good as gold, that's a song of [NAME] lol
Imagine thinking you can learn what you need to about parenting from a paper lol
FFS. I find very few things more upsetting than reading their vile, twisted thought processes. 
I'm just glad they'll chill out in the main sub, they were swarmin.
"What am I supposed to understand from the phrase ""1v1 fam, a duel""."
My husband never watches this show. Watching with me: “[NAME] is a horrible dad. He looks likes he hammered. He’s so greasy”
Damn! You were so close! Scary. Damn damn!
Well I'm scared as shit let's hope for the best, benz should be back(?)
That looks amazing
“Cracking himself up” nearly made me throw up.
I've gotten injured before in RTTS from being hit (Bruised hand). 3 day DL.
Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised
Look at their post history, they're just spouting nonsense to get a rise out of people. Dont be the guy that falls for it, its embarassing
I will never forgive and never forget for this one
Yes, that was indeed the joke, I’m glad you got it ;)
This is being said about every fucking update that lowers the skillgap. Yes, it does change the game because we're already affected
This is brilliant.
Well that's an awful superpower to have. Maybe you could fix [NAME] tho.
Can't help that the president hangs out with the bottom of the barrel.
Oh [NAME] no. Let kinkaid eat it. Don't throw this kid in there. He isn't ready for the AHL yet
She’s still not gonna message you dude I promise
Hey guys, thanks for tuning in to another video on
it's basically summer here right now. these posts are clueless.
We understand! This is a very common reaction to our study. I appreciate you suggesting it :)
Fuck these calls
We have tradable assets next year and cap space the year after. We don’t need to implode to retool.
Not against us this season, apparently. 
It's ridiculous that [NAME] has inspired way more people to join rather than leave but there are way more media articles by people who have left.
>Yes. I’m an idiot. Checks out.
What a crybaby. Don’t drink and drive.
Thank you for highlighting this. No wall. DACA is (almost certainly) fine for another year.
Carelessness will find no clemency in this place! (I was late, it seems that others have already got the best lines...)
At the time, pregnancy out of wedlock was a stoning for having extra marital sex. 
Fear - that's it. You need to work on identifying and overcoming your fears.
New Job? [NAME] is pregnant!
Thank you. I appreciate the advice and I agree with what you said about therapy but I'll keep trying.
You are the expert.
u/dances-with-corgis Says they'll never forget their username. Literally forgot their username. Sorry, but: 😂😂😂😂, that's some [NAME] level tiny mess up.
"You did not say you thought you did you said ""they both blocked me"" and then went back and edited your comment. LOL."
Woah, dude. That's some research! You should totally make video essays and earn some bucks on YouTube.
Gotcha, thanks. Sounds like it's just my ignorance of the game.
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being.
I guess. Thanks.
Banned or moved to different platforms mostly. Never were that many and those that did post here had trouble following the rules and were downvoted heavily.
Ah, alt right thinking. Afraid of people who have anything 'upstairs,' or 'between their ears.'
OH SUCK ME SIDEWAYS
Hmm it seems fun enough to build on my own but thanks!!!
Thanks! Here's hoping silly comic book shows don't trigger you in 2019!
Get yourself a £1. Still occasionally get them.
yea ok dude
You're right, laws don't stop people from committing crimes, we might as well legalize murder. You people sound like retards.
And pizza. Don't forget pizza. The roof of my mouth feels like a battlefield after I have eaten a hot pizza.
*my fat normie slut*
You and your lovable band of losers have already lost!
I mean, DC metro area has ***three times*** Pittsburgh's population, so. Again, relatively, Pittsburgh's is worse.
YESSSS!! The schtick with cameras never failed to delight.
Screw DBs swill, their creepy Children of God (cult) employees, and the traffic mess it creates on Rural in Tempe
Maybe they are just horrible people, and because you aren't like them they don't like you. 
Baby mama was a comedy about this- but with a much happier ending
It's fucking laurel you god damn yanny hearing fascists.
Now I don’t blame [NAME] for his way of thinking😂 people like this wtf
No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
PowerPoint would be nice
My girl [NAME]. She deserves the world.
“That’s also cute” I say as I look at the 5k in LEGO I’m hoarding
I have and i’ve also shot some ak’s they’re not too bad but i still prefer handguns despite the kick.
I fail to see the downside of that.
I'm kinda afraid to ask but did anyone reply?
This feeling is so bad
I love this. BFFs don’t get enough love on these subs, but they make everything better. :)
lool ok I laughed pretty hard at this.
Yes, they suck for making a profit off of people who are proven to be high risk. How dare they!
[NAME] freaking [NAME] all the people down range just staring. -_- GO INSIDE DUMBASSES.
They hated [NAME] since the beginning of [RELIGION], they treated them like animals
I miss mass Rez her new ult is horrendous
"If she is hot and has nice shoes...""I like your shoes."" "
You’re number 1 now.
Love it.
Oh, sorry bud. Didnt mean to be rude
Character and emotions are not the reigning champion one year earlier...
I know I am very worried
I've never decided to have just one late night drunk egg
Screaming at this reply
somebody's sad lol lol
Lol no wonder it's so expensive. I've been wondering if his developers are taking him for a ride.
I just wished they took [NAME] with them.
I've started downvoting people for mentioning meat or animal products in their comments.
That’s not cool
Lmao we really tried that again
Have a nice day sport.
Hey congrats man, you passed your limits, now keep on going Tekken only gets more fun the better you get
I like [NAME] but he's got bizarre mechanics on his jumper and no arc.
I did.
One of my favorite war movies ever. The cast and soundtrack are unbelievable
Multiplayer guys got shafted too. It's sucks, but at least there's some new content.
I thought [NAME] the apostle was *fantastic.* Seeing those early [NAME] suffering like that really drove home what a baby I am.
Yep, had to chase and kept honking. Driver eventually stopped.
You have much to learn
I don't think we could afford the expense bill for coming out of a pretty cushy retirement.
Didn't look that thick either...no snow....this was ending badly no matter what.
I like [NAME] so far, but I know I'm alone in that.
You wont be in pain but you wont feel any relief either. Find what makes you feel comfortable and stick with it
Let's not try to pretend both were equally bad, [NAME] was magnitudes worse
If it’s a one hit kill like the regular crossbow, absolutely would be a fantastic crate weapon.
A beautiful poem for a beautiful thing. Happy cake day btw!
Always go for someone you like and feel connected to.
Thanks for not running our prospects in the Pre-Season anymore!
Pure unadulterated hatred. It’s disgusting.
Sorry man, you’re a great person and all. But margarine??? Downvoted*
[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
Imagining doing something this drastic all alone is just... I can't fathom the anxiety. Man.
I feel like I lost focus... I have not accomplished anything and the clock isn't really stopping
The one with the hot honey is also fantastic. Touch of heat and just a hint of sweet. Good food.
Thanks for the info! Fellow dry eyelids , I guess I'll just keep using my usual.
Just a reminder in case anyone forgot that UGA got embarrassed by Texas:
That is the coolest name
"I like the ""filler"" episodes, believe it or not. I actually get bored by the battles "
LOL where did you hear that?!
Seafood is nasty af. I refuse to prepare seafood in my kitchen.
Well, the bill was about 100+ per person. Must be amazing lunch there.
They still make VCRs? This makes me happy and I’m not quite sure why.
[NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
Marginal taxes was taught in my high school economic literacy class, it's so sad that so many people don't even understand the basics of our tax system 
Well then I’d say you have a pretty good chance if it’s any girl lol
Sorry, every time I try a link post my post fails, I’m just doing a text post. 
One of the rare times I actually laugh out loud while browsing online.
I am afraid to look, but my morbid curiosity draws me to ask.
Well I mean he got erased from existence twice and is still here so I'm guessing it has to be something more than that.
oh yes! i did not know pizza could possibly ever be disgusting until i moved to florida.
Finding that common attraction or chemistry is extremely hard for me. I can totally relate to this.
Nah see that's the kind of pessimism that makes you more depressed. Even if they're not genuine you can still take it to heart.
Shit's going down in Zim. 6 people killed yesterday by army and over 200 arrested.
ITT: People defend delusional shitposts.
No.. that's the exact opposite of what they are.
Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism
Probably the same thing the rest of us do, chuckle and ponder how it can get any worse 😂
come on, Redwings won, Knights need to win. give me another 2-fer, baby!
Never doubt the crazy can get cranked up, as they say, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
Say it louder! I'm sick of these leeches, too.
Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
I get ghosted all the time after I open pics. I don't like it, so would not do it to someone else.
I’m literally shaking right now😫
I don't think it's duping I think it probably loot cycling you can find almost the military gear from on the coast now.
Believe me when i say not having a job doesn't change anything. It's an endless nightmare being ostracized from people your whole life.
Scotland aren’t the best team to compare against. On their day the could debatably beat NZ on a bad day they lose to America
I had my YouTube set to 1.25x speed and didn't notice until I watched this so thanks
Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
At least [NAME] gave us entertainment
Dude, y'all anti American scum don't even believe in science. Fuck off with your generic bullshit because you can't list a specific example. 
I lost it when all the heroes kept going back and forth into siege range
There Probly doing this because we’re for sure gonna tank next year as well
Why the fuck would I post something on r/niceguys and pretend to be the woman talking shit about myself?
Ahhh! good old social forced slavery... For real, good advice, thanks.
lol. good one dude. you really showed me. great argument. really showing off your intellectual prowess. keep up the good work!
[NAME] deliver me from this nightmare I'm stuck in.
not to worry, I'm on the case.
The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
Since 1987 it has been like this, I love this team and this sport.
I want to end myself when it happens
I love you and I love your style. Nice work. Bullies should not be rewarded
Yeesh, let her wallow then. You did the right thing in trying!
Thanks for actually reading and responding to the question...;) I’ll check those out
I'm so depressed
Shut up, don’t block the sanctimony train.
Like who? The one guy stranded in desert already hating his life...
Could they have written a more uninspiring Press Release. Hopefully it is more about [NAME] than [NAME] and [NAME].
IMO, cheaters are only sorry they got caught, not because they betrayed their spouses and had an affair. 
There’s this which is terrifying to think about
"PR is more than just ""optics"". It ain't a new term either. "
Might relax you a little bit but definitely don't expect some amazing buzz from just 1 15mg pill. 15mg might feel like 5-7.5mg diazepam.
I'm just salty man. I hate playing Houston. I'm sure it's a nice place to live.
"No. I'm against the idea that one can ""liberate"" farm animals in the same way we can liberate human societies."
That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.
That's my plan!
It would be okay if they will turn them into some old non-obtainable premiums. I mean limited edition
Ha ha, that's absolutely fair enough. :)
I really like this photo.
How many times do you have to watch The Office. lol!
Oo! OO!! I know this one... ME!
Why? That's not helping us win games.
Devastating to hear of any news like this :(
Good advice thank you I appreciate it. I need to learn to focus my mind again
My mommas homemade mac and cheese almost makes me cry on how great it is
Ouch! That hit hard
The man in the picture is a legend since he is the only non toxic and not annoying mic person
Well, this is the first time I've seen that in over three years.
ain't that just a beatiful thought
The fuck you call me!? A cunt!? Damn man, didn’t know I meant so much to you, right in the feels.
It's great.
Last couple countries that tried that got destroyed by international communists.
Oh perfect- I am surrounded by [RELIGION] and they LOVE those kinds of “parties”
dont let the spirit of rock die motherfucker aroooooo
Ive seen that move no less than 5 times and I still get irrationally angry at the Harvard rich kid
Thanks for the encouragement, it means a lot! Glad you liked it, seeya around 👌
I just don’t see why he pushed me leave with him so bad just to dip when I did
I don't think my town has a market.
More like trash ass link. Wtf is “Apple Music”, probably some shitty limewire ripoff.
Ooof. I have a hard time trusting asexuals who declare this information mid elationship.
His team is chasing away any hope at a playoff berth
Yes! I love their responses to anyone who comments. So much shade.
You have just been r/woooshed
I was so sad when they took SG1 off of Netflix. I guess it’s on Prime now? I need to rewatch that show.
That’s sick!
That isn't the issue. The issue is shilling your channel.
i dont give a flaming fart about averages. most people have no taste in comedy.
That definitely makes him a terrorist.
Not sure if you're joking. Not sure if I disagree. But since the point of high school is daytime teenager containment google would not accomplish that.
Lucky you, some people have all the love 
Did you win? We need one positive thing out of this disaster of a Saturday night.
So just for the record, I’m with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. 🏈
Funny thing, I work at a restaurant and it happened today, which is what pushed me to post this. 
Show him how hilarious season 1 and 2 of Family Guy is. Then show him how incredibly stupid the rest of the series is.
That's how Catholicism works.
This is one of the worst written posts I've seen on this sub for a while
I hope all of y'all that are commenting isn't all men because not all women do that!
Haha, that's terrifying 
Now that's brilliant... 30? woah. I'm only 19, hope it doesn't take me that long 
We got a great view around 9pm before the rain!
I totally agree with you, I just wish she hadn't tossed his sweater away :(
I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
[NAME], let's celebrate together, y'all will be the king of New York. Praise Marks.
Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard.
Totally and sorry for that
Thank you so much, kind stranger. I really need that
I love your username.
Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :(
he's an awesome bro
[NAME] : completely unpredictable Bunch of them were standing together in the middle of the ring lol
I can't pluck it, hurts too much. So every few days I shave a strand of hair on my chin.
Hah haha ha hah ha I am going to use this one now.
Find like-minded people you can have meaningful conversations with. Everything else I consider a waste of my spare time.
After [NAME] comment the stock prices fell and the [NAME] was never heard from again. Crab juice went up 4 points
Bingo - using market cap as your yardstick is as stupid as using GDP as a yardstick. One metric is never enough to capture a picture.
I SWEAR I DIDNT MEAN TO ANSWER 2 HOURS LATER FORGIVE MEEE
We're more concerned with this mysterious group of r/atlantahawks sleeper agents downvoting [NAME]
This post gave me incredible anxiety until I saw the back tires rolling sideways which was amazing.
HAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAa no
Are those both not true statements? Everyone loves attractive people, even employers.
More rudeness, misogyny and sexism from [NAME]. If it wasn't so predictable it would be upsetting. [NAME]. 
It happened in back to back home games earlier this season but hasn’t happened since.
Australian here. I hereby agree that this does in fact provoke nightmares.
I have. Take care
I wasn't saying it was. But it's the most likely explanation of why a youtuber would want to pretend they have one.
Another episode of idiots with guns
Very interesting study.
You have to assert dominance or they'll never learn.
Lol aren’t you the guy that got banned from UKPol for being too left wing? I have to say guy that’s pretty impressive.
It's kinda funny when it's told to you
Stop following me around you one hour old troll account.
I feel stupid for not looking at her bio, but I do have some more pictures 
you're [NAME]
This physically hurt me
I spent like 6 hours overnight browsing the top posts here when I decided to check it out I hate how much I can relate
Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
Thank you!!
This is dank what the hell
Frinkiac not working for you?
Pretty sure it’s going on in the apartment across from me right now. My neighbors are trashy
I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he’s gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious
Nah man you need to have NEGATIVE IQ to enjoy that show, cuz the weed ain't working.
That's just....sorry, but stupid is the only correct word.
Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
Oh I get it, you are illiterate on purpose because you fear to be fed with lies (in your mind). Sorry for you.
That was quite the read, very good story!
Yeah, hah. 
Really bad trap if noone falls for it
Thank you for the references!
I just want instant run off voting, which wasn't one of the three options.
Now this is poke choking!
I agree. It seems the recruiter is a poor communicator and I think that is where some of my apprehension is coming from.
It *feels* unethical?
No you pick a different hero. Aint fkn rocket science.
Well that wasn’t my argument all i said was that the second amendment is aimed att the state
I’m easy going, I take everything with a smile. People around me often comments how I’m always in a good mood. 
Even if she was 25 this would have been weird and creepy af.
Feeling tacky ? You already working for [NAME] - might as well play the part haha
Thanks. Though tbh I think some 3D characters, [NAME] etc could fit in. Though they might be some unlockable characters hidden maybe. 
I love the arm blasts on the ice. That dude was determined and loves his dog. Very cool.
That sounds terrible.
I believe so
I wish i could upvote more than once
In my experience I've also noticed his friends and got ditched by my girlfriend.
You are so right. Reddit response of reading only the first few words. It's been a long damn week. My apologies.
I appreciate that there's correct number of YES in there. It's so rare.
Cool. I'll have to keep that banter in mind for the next time it happens. Thank you for the response, I really appreciate it
I’m so nervous!
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
these [NAME] impersonators are getting terrible
Gotta protect’em!
I love you, as a feminist with ASD words are very hard for me and you described this so well
I’m sorry :(
What scares me is that now that this happened, they're going to try and find ways to take women's phones away from them.
Makes it a lot less stressful tho. Regretting staying up this late tho
"Ah the classic ""I don't deserve you"" argument."
As a non-religious that’s fascinated by [RELIGION], I love this 😅.
It still seems dangerous
Sitting there dreaming of hot girls coming up to you in your room is better.
That’s too bad, I didn’t know that.
Bloody Sundae ([NAME] x [NAME]).
Omg that was the WORST
Those scars look fairly recent. Just remember no matter what there are people who love you and will support you unconditionally!
Still pretty alarming. Thanks for these.
"Adjust your W4. Everyone has to pay taxes, so save it with the ""I have to send a check to the government!"" BS. "
Ok cheers. I’m banned from there
Our knight in shining armor. I'll miss those high socks
I am annoyed by autoplay they added on hover - and commercials would make me drop the subscription instantly.
Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don’t qualify😞
I love this. Now I'm craving tacos in the morning.
Need to go middle of the road no [NAME] is going to vote for [NAME].
You guys are fools. This is gold.
I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(
Fecking THANK YOU. -- One Foot on Each Side of The Pond
">""Fuck it Im on my way out anyway"" ""Fuck it Im on my way out to Seattle"""
Definitely my favorite reliever after Mo. loved his attitude and competitiveness.
sweet home alabama
I am so upset for you and your family. She knew what she was doing, which makes this even more horrifying.
Sorry I have to ask your age before I yell you.
You're right and I hate it.
"This is why the option isn't ""be accurate"" but ""be as accurate as you can"""
First chance to open reddit today, am not disappointed in this being my top post in my feed. Thanks. 
Nice try russia
I’ve literally done this when drunk before, I doubt it was you but my apologies nonetheless haha 
Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍
Nice try, officer.
Doing a good job getting Dell involved.
This is a pure salty thread. Congratulations, dear Sir/Madam.
What a fucking cunt
Wow amazing, anyone know where can I find more at higher resolution?
That 2nd goal was all [NAME]. What a move, and against the best team in the league!
Rip ok lol
Lol this pregame about players sucking and getting sent down and then coming back up later and doing better. A giant message to our facebook fans.
I work from home but I still get up early for me time. House is nice and quiet at 6am.
Stranger: **Compliments me** Me: I'M SORRY!!
Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [NAME], but unfortunately for some a lot of the government is never coming back from this.
Guilty... waaaaay over sold myself on my resume about 12 years ago.
Yay!!! Finally the fix we're all looking for after hours of endless scrolling.
Glad I wasn’t the only who noticed. Annoyed me slightly.
Mugging is just how we show love around here. Respect our culture.
So. He is such a premature ejaculator that he goes before someone can take a breath? That's just amazing.
I hate beer. But I'll concede the point because others like it. ;)
I love it. More bad blood. Cod esports baby!!
That’s because it’s stupid and nobody wants it!
That's ma'am!
A one-line whip is still whipping against, although it is a pretty disappointing decision.
This is seriously disturbing. Even more disturbing, is that we aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s going to expand. Watch. 
Thank god. This place was authoritarian.
it depends on the page you moron.
If you like Thai food, try Firefly.
You really are this stupid aren’t you? Whatever buddy I don’t argue spastics.
Honestly, it would be even better if she handed the reigns to a brick. Then no deal definitely happens and everyone's happy ever after :D
[NAME] You are the ultimate forhead Winner!!! Chose your price!
*[when your pet is still barking at you]* I'm done trying to convince you.
Lmao Chicago coach is letting [NAME] die, their backup would probably fare worse to be fair though
Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies
That’s cool man! You have a good night!
What a political whore Uncle [NAME] is!
Bulls medical staff misdiagnosing again, what else is new
I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
I probably would have upvoted it for effort.
I mean just let it go and assume things aren’t going to work out. Drop it, so to speak.
I would smash both
Just some statistics I saw bud. Calm down.
Good demo
Find a new doctor. If he isn't willing to treat people because of political affiliation then he's a horrible doctor and an even worse person.
Thanks for your addition! I didn’t know any mercy players who made good content for her so I left her out. Appreciate it!
I'm a firm climate change believer but jeez that was painful to read. Sorry, this is far from bestof
Does Instagram and Facebook have these nested ads/ articles? I’m not on social media enough to notice. Well Reddit, but I never see ads. 
Cheers, [NAME]!
I'm sorry that happened. Was her hospice nurse aware that she was suffering?
Let’s beat these Lakers!
Then the argument is entirely wrong. Democratic socialist are not communists. Conservatives aren't fascists.
It's like 20,000 words about a teenager. Fucking insanity.
I’ve been hurt too many times for it all to have been for nothing
Stop laughing at me.
But you'll downvote and complain but not provide any reasoning for your complaints? You sound like a child. Grow up.
Why are you okay with racism and why are slurs the red line?
I am not running around talking about how I am going to beat up my kids teachers. Not sure where you got tough guy from that...
That’s why I called them Turd Gen, haha. Getting a High Country/Denali with the 6.2 to replace it. 
News flash scrims don’t mean shit.
I have the same issue with a new co-worker and it drives me insane.
because my dogs wouldst know why I left. gotta give that little floof ball the best life he can have
Brave soul.
He looks so young, always thought he was older than me.
I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought that.
Wow, this is terrifying.
This person should be outed to the world. What a reckless pos
*losing hope Loose is what your mom is
He's a good fit, not a perfect fit. Same goes for [NAME]. 
"Yes, absolutely. ""But woe to the one who betrays me. It would have been better for that man, if he had never been born."""
Such a disappointment
That's just sad if it's for a game
I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
The worst is ‘get in a group with someone you don’t already know’
Too bad it's the wrong kind of blows!!!
Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit
Haha that's amazing.
Wow she’s getting a spud in the head the next time I see her!
I live in Shanghai and order directly from a plantation in Yunnan espresso roasts for home consumption. Absolutely fantastic.
Nah, lady will come to the resc... oh, sorry, forgot
I love the name!
Was stabbed by a pencil when I was younger, can confirm gave me all the knowledge of the universe.
I have a feeling if my car won’t start my ETL would come and Uber me to work
In a few years she will probably be claiming to be in her 30s!
Thank you for being the voice of reason in here while people keep screaming about the Vatican's thousand-year old wall.
I can't read Korean. Out of curiosity, what are the others?
He seems sweet and I think he really loves her.
"Hey its you again. Dude can you please say ""N"" so I can complete the task? My last request went unanswered sadly."
No, no, Amazon! Ripping is painful! ‍♀️ Be *gentle* to your abby wabbies. *Gentle*. *pats you* ❤❤☺
Makes no sense. What the hell are you trying to achieve ? Sound like a dumho
That would be **[NAME]** Who is also awesome.
He'll be the difference maker in the playoffs. He can get any shot he wants because of his all time great ball handling
Heat is one of my top movies. The whole thing is fucking amazing.
Whaaaaaaat the heck was that?
Pistons need more picks and less aging players. Get as many picks as possible and hope to get lucky.
I can't stand when a team member has no shoes, the sound drowns out other sounds for me and its just incredibly annoying to listen to all game
**Takes away membership card* HOW DARE YOU SIR!!!
Made me so angry to read that, I almost downvoted your comment. Upvoted, for sure. Grr! 
Thank you for the context. Everything makes sense now, I'd forgotten how... Certain kinds of people can be
Don't you understand, the people affected are [shuffles deck] able to get a 0% loan until the shutdown is over.
Well, I'd love to see an MLS side defeat Liverpool like Red Star did in this years Champions League.
At least they didn’t destroy the shoes
Sonofabitch that makes it so much better [NAME] Edit: you talking about this?
Just say that you don't like it. It tastes of blood, tears, and death.
yet another infuriating loss, against a garbage team no less
can he break throws though? just kidding. yellow is the season 2 green, OP dude. keep focussing on small steps. better rank will follow later.
Don't worry, you'll find love, I promise! I hope you love yourself as well. <3
Sorry, there was a little bitterness in my voice from how my father treated me. Not directed at OP. I am in the wrong. 
Haha I hope this is real. Look up neti pot. Warm water will soften the paper and come out.
Hahha i agree but i still want him to say sorry.
Nice try @ some dude. Also i joke around my gf on the same topic, she doesnt believe me
Which part of what I wrote sounds like a baseless claim? Could you clarify me, please?
Lmao y'all are in for a real rude awakening with [NAME] if y'all thought *those* were soft.
Why slum it if they’re giving you actual cost?
This is so good!
He's becoming a more subtle [NAME]. I like it
Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.
Wish they'd update Trapper's and Wraith's. They're so boring.
This was the one post that truly frightened me about the insane left. They are a cult, and not on our side.
I like the high ground suggestion. Thanks
It was definitely [NAME] goal. The stadium announcer incorrectly gave it to [NAME] though.
Of fucking course it is...
Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.
I love assault
Hah, serves him right.
The American way is to show some empathy for others come on dude
I mainly play EDH. Did try standard at one point as well but lost interest
Congratulations puppy, here have some cake.
Reality is often disappointing
I blame all of y'all, y'all told [him he] was funny
Good for [NAME]. He deserves it.
Like a turd in a big toilet
I'm sick of them eating my cheddar.
"""Do we need a GoFundMe for automated doors"" hahahah!"
Lmao “9 times out of 10” okay
His time will come for that
Exactly what i was thinking!
"With the up and coming hit single ""I have a new Daddy every week""."
This is not a why were they filming. The person filming clearly saw it from further away, and then got closer after turning on the camera.
*I hate laughing!*
[NAME] didn't contribute anything! [NAME] or [NAME], please come back. At they least you do something on the court!
She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality.
By [NAME]! That’s [NAME] music!
You're the biggest sack of shit to post here in some time.
"I used to sell appliance parts. Yes, I need your model number. No, the part you are looking for isn't ""standard."""
The only sub that’s really bad now is the GKS the others are fine actually.
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀I’m bad at this game🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
This chick is a lunatic now
Love u too booboo
Home field advantage is barely a thing lmao also I hate the Patriots, you're just being an idiot.
I don't believe you, but even if that were true it still harms nobody
You’ve got a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. 
Pretend you are the lead in a movie. You will probably get laid, confidence is everything. Bingo bango, great night!
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
You do realise that a toilet lid doesn't make the toilet air tight, so the toxic poo ridden air you're so worried about would still escape.
You gotta love the process.
As much as I love cold fries, reddit karma is oh so good!
You better have done 3oh!3 proud and twisted
Happy new years!!
Everyone hates these posts but when we do post them it’s because we too are also proud of the work we do. Congrats!
Yeah it seems more like a joke than someone Bible thumping
Your attempts to belittle me show only more insecurities on your part.
Eat my fuck- [NAME]
NOT THE [NAME] ALBUM LMAOOOO
You die.
Show down there heretic. You obviously meant to say: Unquestionable truth, any diversion from what seems to be true only comes from our own limitations. /s
I mean Darkfall really has the best combat but the rest of the game lacks.
I hate that. PC is way better for using the internet. I also hate how all the important features for the website missing on phone version.
Sorry I should have said army.
Delete this. Not relevant.
No car wraps? This was already upvoted a dozen times... Seriously don't understand the mods, man. 
migration lol
This really hurts my feelings.
I'm lactose intolerant, still I hope u OP and everyone else loves their slices.
I hope Edmonton gets nuked.
Haha me too! I just told my husband they were my favs and I never thought that would happen with BOTH of them.
We’re honouring good King Billy. That’s also how we decided which [NAME] brother to buy.
A site was the good site on old cobble, so they changed it and left the awkward B site alone. Thanks volvo
No apologies needed, beer loving friend!
[NAME] is just awesome. I have vacancies for long range adoptive grannies if she's not busy?
This just made me feel so much better about myself :)
Is that her official name now? [NAME]
Good because I've been waiting since September!
Great, thanks :) remember, just let it go!
You’re obsessed, get over it man. We have what we have, they have what they have
u/-adamsmith perfect troll account name, but at least he united all of r/MLS. Thanks for teaming up, everyone.
really hope that is the case. Gotta keep the optimism up
You’re right
Preach my dude I know how it feels to get downvoted by the sheep
>Emotions like this will get you killed. That is too bad, considering I was planning on living forever.
I looked at several different websites - mine are not perfect. But I like them. Mostly referenced this website.
I like that we get to see how varied artists are.
Another picture of [NAME] please thanks
Haha I was just thinking that. You've become a very diverse club. The Hobart Darwin Tigers. Training facility in Wagga.
It's pretty stupid. Yes
Ew her text is touching her photo, what a slut
Agreed, if you think about the animals it's sad. If you think about zerocarbers' blood profiles it gets amusing.
He had a dark haired mother and white-blonde haired dad. He's got his mom's looks. That's it.
Yeah well you’re a horrible [NAME]
The people of NI need to know the joy of football special
women dont seem to think so.
I enjoyed watching the crazy old man being dragged out at the end.
What should be the campaign is telling people that just because you find a child beautiful/pretty, it doesn't mean you're sexually attracted. 
Whoops. Didn’t know that was a thing. Thanks!
Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny
Pay you for what, just standing there? Done.
As a college student that played football I'm with you lol. My team smashed mcdonalds all the time and it was great
[NAME] was pretty cool on The Challenge so I would love to see him on CBB.
Great advice here. Good sleep doesn’t “just happen” with kids. It’s our job as parents to guide them.
Shhhhh you are devastating their argument. You might trigger them. It’s the only trigger they love.
Wait, this is an INDUSTRY person? Wtf.
Wow im glad my uncle is dead , this sounds crazy .
Girlfriend is straight off of Shop Hush social app and onto reddit. Someone tell her, its slightly embarrassing.
Wasn't me I'm the defensive [NAME]. But trust me we were all equally confused, and delighted.
Now it's cheering for the two to come back
There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it. 
He's practicing difficult shots too much thus loosing a feeling for easy ones.....
I agree. Could go either way.
Thank you soooo much 😍
I thought it was going to cut to them still trying to get it out of its mouth! When the kid was holding it again I lost it
Just remember I love you
Cant wait to start working my placement around that area!
I saved up for a top hat recently and it turns out not to fit as I have a large skull. Thanks for your kind words.
Ha! I actually included that on purpose, was poking fun at me (and the typical MS3) :)
There’s a fine line between love and hate, you know. 
Looks fun up there
One of my favorite shows of all time.
Oh no, her eyebrows
He doesn't He just want to get the F*** out of there.
I like him
I wasn't ready for the wholesomeness when I saw it.
I think of [NAME] hot dogs. I hate that I love them so much.
Ok cheers mate thank you
for me it was def the egg yolk. i’m pouting as i reluctantly eat it.
You’re absolutely correct
Lol I’m just fucking around I can wait
I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
I agree. She seemed to truly love [NAME] . [NAME] loves the life [NAME] provides fir him. It’s a sad situation.
That isnt sustainable.
I really hope this is what happens.
Lol at the self-own of thinking “literally” is a “big word”, with a cherry of being too stupid to understand the context on top.
I told you you’re right it’s silly anyone would care about foreign intelligence attempting to influence elections. What a silly joke.
No. Just no.
This is awesome. What did they play?
Just goes to show how stupid they are
Support this cause please. It saves lives
I'm glad the republican won cause I want the best high I have had 5 back surgeries and need another.
Comfy girl = best girl
She doesn’t want me to pay. She also doesn’t want me to have any input.
Very scary.
Sorry, the two different names made me thing those were two different places. ^ ^;
It's also my 40th birthday, so bring a gift! 
Good to know my paranoia has paid off haha, and same, sooo many snacks.
This guy doesn’t know how to life...
"""Help! It's an educated brown woman! Help meeeeee!"""
She said that? Wtf?? That's fucked up. I shouldn't be surprised. Hypocrisy is common with this bunch.
Lol religion is a crazy thing
I spend a lot of time worrying about how and why that'll happen to me as I get older.
Hate this guys videos
> i have never even dated a girl. Lol
No, but its a big problem in itself. 
...and they're gone. Didn't even get to see what they cost.
You can thank [NAME] for that. He wouldn't commit to taking [NAME]. He wanted to play for [NAME]. He shunned uncertainty, not the Jets.
What a journey.
Not to be critical, but “rethuglican” is an awful one 
Yeah I didn't like getting clawed from that far away. IF it has that big of a hitbox, it shouldn't be that far reaching
"""I've made a huge mistake"" - Me, walking into this person's house."
Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]
No Despacito Remix. No 4K Ultra. No Goals and Highlights. No 360 No-Scope Assists. Are you even excited man?
[NAME], they've turned into jerks.
Living here. Now my daughters biggest aspiration is to leave this place, and I can’t say I blame her. 
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
I’ve never stolen anything to do this with an Italian accent.
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who snorted at it!
I like that!
Go your own way, loser. 
Thank you so much. I will check them out as well.
Yeah, I really thought [NAME] would take his game to the next level coming here, not a big step back. Hopefully consistency will help him out. 
Niemi is absolutely amazing tonight
It is his welcome, he can do with it as he wishes. Your misunderstanding is forgiven.
Funny, coming from the tool circle jerk reddit.
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)
a lost art
The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
So weird watching this segment knowing what happened a couple days ago.
Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror
Now THIS IS shitposting
Oh my [NAME] strawberry watermelon menthol that sounds amazing
But those other jobs are what allow the engine of US imperialism to keep running, and keep destroying innocent people's lives all around the world. 
Thank you! [NAME] is drafting off this documentary.
Its an unpopular opinion because it kind of makes you sound lika a douchebag and its lowkey homophobic edit:meant to reply to [NAME]
I live in those unfortunately
Seconded. 8 years and I never reached the final castle.
Haha, small world, I live/work in the Twin Cities already! 😂
Solid r/ThisIsMyLifeNow material. I love it. They’re such gorgeous dogs!
Well the last sentence reallt hurts, but still I'll do my best to stay with her and keep her happy. I really love this girl
Good deal, thanks
Ooh, good point!
“Stop replying to me as I send you a message first!” Oh, meat eaters ❤️
Knowing the only evidence they had was your confession: priceless.
That’s really cool! How did you do this?
You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
I didn't know operation was a failure to be honest lol just knew what it was
Their faces tho, LOL
[NAME] i was mostly curious about the background because it's very good.
How dare you say that. He's a toad of the people! Not some rich frog!
Yeah - we never had a fight. I'm glad we managed to end it in good terms. Thanks a lot for the sentiment, mate. Cheers!
The worst part is the character in the image behind it is great and this just hurts to read in his voice.
As a white man on the internet I'm outraged... because I had to laugh and laughing hurts right now : (
This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. 
Mine is Woman by [NAME] 😂 I get the chills when I hear that song. Maybe it is a hymn?
Love it [NAME]
Then he is still able to achieve salvation in [NAME] grace. I will pray for him, and for all your lost souls. [NAME] bless.
How dare you hate [NAME]
Tortilla chips are the worst oml. One time a piece got lodged between my gum and my tooth. Like, that fella was /deeply/ embedded in my gum
Looking for 3 tix for the Leafs on the 10th. Upper or lower. Thanks!
"""It's your outfit, dude."""
Thanks for the recommendations!
I appreciate it, that's good to know. I hope I'll have to apply that knowledge one day
My son is ten months. I hope we have this relationship when he turns 14. Congrats on your lovely teen ♥️
I'm so excited for this game!! 😄
Honestly, no. But even vague references would do more to help decide if it's a fresh take on something.
Depression is being sad when there's no reason to be. Losing two ws back to back now that's a reason to be sad
Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.
It's weird how quickly I agreed with you. Usually I'da been more incredulous.
I’ll be there later this year. Can’t wait.
We don’t improve without discovering our problems. Good on you man- wish you and your boyfriend many happinesses 🙂
I like that, will be looking forward to seeing it when I go there. Sure, it's stereotypical. Who cares?
Indifferent before leaving. Indifferent after. Although hasidic [NAME] are fucking mental.
I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
$2M AAV, love this deal
[NAME] path made me hate everything associated with pirates
Our 2nd unit is as bad as anybody in the NBA
Cheers, I have some cheese left in the fridge that I can use here, thanks for the info.
As someone who went through school before the internet existed, yes, weird creepy kids existed. Although it was more in your face. 
Love this. I thought I replied this morning, but I’m definitely taking your ideas and going to try them! Best of luck
That, but I also really think that [NAME] is going to be a top QB. Especially, if he progresses during his time as back up.
I feel genuine sorrow for your family having to be associated with a cretin such as yourself
Weird, I thought I had a different twitter handle than that
I got to see some fish at a science museum not long ago and it really brightened my day, too.
In the wild, it’s expected that something unexpected will always happen i guess 
Happy new years!!!!
Haha yea few cars drive worse than a Versa. Aside from performance, what are some must haves/wants?
These people seen so much in their lifetimes. So much wisdom in one pic
Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.
What the hell is going on at Getty Images?
**YOU CANNOT MURDER ME! IT'S ILLEGAL.**
It’s pretty cringe
I agree with this post times a billion and also: Save [NAME]! Love the name. Huge Fight Club fan.
Oh boy I was wide awake when I lost my under 51.5. [NAME] can go fuck his ugly self
I wanna give [NAME] a mosquito bite
[NAME] my friend and if he has new friends I’m ok with that.
Its natural to fear what is unknown. Especially when someone is trying to force you to open a sketchy box while probably grinning the whole time.
[NAME] is a good basketball player
Poeling is looking like a fkn stud. Imagine our C depth next season... [NAME]... holy fuck
Well damn, sounds more reliable then shit like and all that
Great to see him involved.
[NAME] looking like [NAME] out there
That’s not a good thing to do. And taking it into account for sentencing is fine. But she’s still guilty.
Do your own research. It’s not my job to educate you.
A derogatory term.
money always talk. i want more to learn from this lesson.
I actually had to rewind a few times because I found myself getting distracted because I was kind of bored.
The dog has a very confused look on his face lol.
Bonus: her infamous bizarre introduction video. Truly frightening
That’s pretty amazing. You made me smile for sure today man. Cheers on a talent and a great setup.
I love this and you
I used to get messages from neck fetishists a lot because I have a long neck lmao I didn't even realize that was a thing
this has happened to me twice...most embarrassing shit
This person is the smartest person to play town of salem literally 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999991000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001234567898765432345676543345678987654345678909876543234567898765432345678909876543234567898765432345678987654323456787654345676543456543456434543434343434323456765434567654323454323456543345678987654323456789876565656565656565656565656565454545654565454323456765432345678765456 IQ
There was no need to crap on this guys feelings but you decided to anyway. At least you did the right thing a helped him dodge a bullet.
Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
Congrats dude!
Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
Nope...this master criminal knewe!
Hello! Happy new years my friend!
Fuck you I was in the bed:/
Hey thanks!
He was horrible
Well i gave you my reasoning, if you're not interested in responding why waste you're time being annoying. 
No dude! Don't you get it?! Women are like cats! /s
Ahh gotcha - thanks :)
Yet, here we are, a whole sub full of people who seem interested in the stupid things incels say and do... 🤔 /s
We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.
Congrats mate.
haha someone's gotta rep for our struggling sports programs
Wait so the aboleth only kills you if you dont do what the dm says
I honestly can't imagine [NAME] using any kind of profanity lol
Didn’t see anything about exercise or nutrition in there. Shits important
As long as he knows [NAME] won’t take his shit lol
With just coffee and nothing fancy I did love the Komodo blend back in the day.
[NAME] lost her guitar canonically
That's definitely sexism, same with that ad
And let us not forget the lord's privilege with a new bride. Ahhhh......the good old days.
The best terror
I play around 2hs per day since launch. 1/2 Cuz I like the game. 1/2 In hope for a new expansión/fix to get the players back X:
Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
Oh that's lovely.
That poor mercy. Just died to die again xD
Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.
That sounds simple and good
Anyone who downvoted this comment doesn’t understand the necessity of government.
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.
I am so mad I haven’t thought of doing this. Just brilliant
Go to about the 13 minute mark. It gets better for her.
honestly i don’t mind it but ik some people do and i rly don’t care enough to get into that
Fierljeppen heck!
How is this any different from women who claim that all men are awful people? I'm sure you dislike it when women do that.
Am I not supposed to have what I want, what I need
I actually really like this, and unironically find it funny. Forgive me.
I compleatly get it. It makes me not trust people over the littlest things.
That opening is quite terrible tbh
Np good luck!!
This isn’t true right? That would be incredibly funny
I miss [NAME] butt.
Fuck sake man
Why is this getting downvoted. I love Meepo so much. :(
Thank you for providing an unbiased & sensible opinion.
The republicans are the military. You are an idiot.
I'd like to apologize on behalf of all Azwel mains.
[NAME] this is so true, sometimes i will remember it like 5 years later and still regret it
It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
Thanks man, appreciate it :D
Doctor charged 400 bucks for a blood pressure check before renewing my wife's high BP medication. She HAS been acting a little weird la
Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
I actually currently have a girlfriend and I love her. It's just that those past situations gave me trust issues for life I guess.
The funny thing is [NAME] would probably be up for it. Let's do it! LoL sAiNtS
That’s good to know- thank you!
VUC YOU IDIOT!!!!
Thats nice to hear, glad I could help.
Both good and not so good, but mostly good! You should DESTROY HER. NOBODY NEEDS TO TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE CURB. 
you seem like the kind of person i’d like to be best friends with! :)
A ray of light and a beacon of hope. Absolutely beautiful.
That's a shame.. speaking of that though. Where are some good places to hear blues in the city?
You're pointing at me You pointed first I'm signaling that's not pointing Stop pointing at me!
It's a beautiful video of family and [NAME] finally accepting [NAME] as a brother is one of the highlights of the show
I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
Same, there was no thanks or consideration that they’d just given her the ‘night off’.
Followup comment that not-so-subtly requests gold by feigning ignorance or pandering to the pathos of uninspired premium redditors.
I too rationalize how bad my my ex-girlfriend is now that she's gone. 8(
That was never in discussion all Miami wanted was to get rid off the whole contract.
"Couldn't really fit this as a ""how to,"" does that mean I have to go to jail now? Source: "
We can't let the 8 year olds who are playing an M rated game see all of this bad language!!
Considered going for the 1st time this year, then I see all the ads targeting kids specifically. Feels weird as a 26 year old seeing all this..
Oooff I really hope this doesn't happen 😰😨😰
Yes, I wouldn't have said it if it weren't true lol. It's owned by InBev which is a Belgian company. 
If you're smearing shit between your cheeks merely from standing might I suggest you take a wider stance when popping and maybe get some more fibre in your diet
Poor kid. He just wanted to rescue his mum from a nefarious organisation. I hope he gets decent representation.
I wish they would put dfs in for [NAME] right now
Nothings better then 2 teams that know exactly wut happend/parents that saw the game two coaches and a ref no good lawyer needed rlly just those people to talk
what a stupid opinion
I finished high school back in 2010 friend but yes good luck to me for the weekend 😎
I have been saying this for a long time, he is way overpaid and the forward position is our main weakness since [NAME] left. 
Welcome home [NAME]!
Why are our trolls so boring :(
Now ask me if I care. It's irritating and stupid.
Everyone likes [NAME].
Great, now my balls hurt and I’m yawning uncontrollably. 
Running a company will be the same disappointment. Your problem is unsolved.
I thought it was something about the dog not smelling your drugs, but now i'm just sad that you didn't get to pet it :(
I went there once and was like “yeah neat I guess” around the same time. Totally forgot about it until I saw the pic of the door
I don’t believe so. I got it when the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit was in my city.
Thank you so much! Having these few subs for the quality videos he's creating makes the channel a hidden gem.
Every right requires someone else's labor. The whole - / + rights thing is a stupid argument.
I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all
I’d rather have 50$ every time I see a variation of this prompt lol
Oh damn, look at that areshole telling the truth. Get him.
"Is it weird that my first thought was ""at least it's not a Minion?"" "
If you’ve never been to DSA you’d be surprised by how many amazing, smart people you’ll meet. 
Wonder no more, this is coming out like next year
Thank you. I'm just so shocked that this is in Arizona. This looks like it belongs somewhere completely different.
Nice of you to have some social awareness. I’m sure he appreciates that.
It is good game, they are good generation!
Oh come on, they’ll survive it all, they LOVE EACH OTHERRRR!!!
What the Fuck?
I find it gross, especially when it starts to cool. Chicken is great but leave it out of my dip and off my pizza.
oh thats nasty!
Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this.
The highest rate of eating disorder in men is binge eating disorder... I fail to see how a pressure to l ok good causes binge eating disorder
First I was afraid, I was petrified...
If this data were exportable in CSV format. I would love this website long time. (Github link for feature contributions maybe?)
Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests.
You’re an animal, and you deserve all the shame/repercussions you get.
Omgggg i’m dying at Stassi. She looks like she was going for a jersey shore look. Shes still gorgeous though
[NAME] on twitter is way different that [NAME] on youtube... anyways i love tsm no matter the tiltles no matter the rosters lets have a good year !
Wow. What is wrong with you
I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
You know better. People will just ignore this and move on to their next talking point.
I've finally found my people who know the struggle.
Everyone is reporting about it on TV. Was cool to see the highlight.
Tell him congrats. And that he srsly needs to work on his bunting; it's just painful to watch.
I needed to read this because I felt so bad for this guy... I just can't imagine a long walk home in winter.
This is interesting. You want to share experiences with her but not necessarily have sex with her?
You're making yourself look more stupid with every reply. Google what the heck model organisms are.
U dumb.
5 1/2 years until the presidential next election... Let's hope [NAME] can figure something out in that time.
Congratulations, you did it
"I sure as sugarplums aint seen any ""gives"" around "
We are up 2-0 and this game is pissing me off so much.
I’ll give this a look. Thanks for consideration.
Play stupid games stamkos, win stupid prizes
That edge just got fire polished.
And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft.
remember what you're fighting for
I appreciate your optimism in saying just a few more years
I mean, it was season two level of “what the fuck are you doing writers?!”
Yeah, what do you know about her? Her Wikipedia page is pretty barren.
I got mine at 21. The ex wife would have had me snore instead of wear it for years.
It’s definitely winter. My Cornish Rex is in hell right now because she loves laying in windows, but it’s cold as balls out 
Ya. It's not what you think to start. Awesome show ending within 5 seasons with a planned ending. It's refreshingly hilarious. Netflix available.
2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
By ranting aimlessly on the internet about it, obviously ;)
Federal employee here. My amazing tenant offered to pay two months in advance to help with my cash flow.
The minute I heard about this this morning, I just knew [NAME] would use it for his benefit someway, somehow... lol. :/
This hurts my brain
Well at least we won't have to spend as much time watching this.
I'd say British humor isn't for everyone. I think he was on point most of the time.
I love [NAME] as much as the next [NAME], but seriously man. Whatchu doing son?
Absolutely. That was an amazing set of games. Didn’t miss a beat
The day I die is the day I'm happy
Woohoo! He is motivated and awesome!
That is a great idea! I will propose in in my next session.
facetune is hard work you fucking pore. I work all day to support this family and this is the thanks I get?
Oh I haven’t even found those! That’s hilarious though.
It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. 
“What the FUCK is this [NAME], explain!”
This is so creepy. Good riddance to awful rubbish.
[NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language.
Those bastards lied to me
That would be perfect! Wish I had that.
Ugh thank you everyone 😭❤️
Deservedly so too. Tbh I think you must be the favourites.
If we trade him I don’t think be will be a playoff team :(
Those ears...those horrible ears
yea so disgusting
Cheers, [NAME]!
I've seen some unfunny comment sections on r/jokes but this one takes the cake.
That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
Amazing. Perfect ending.
this guy is such a douchebag
Huh that guy seems cool, they'd probably lop his head off. 
Love The Weasle, I've grown to like him a lot 
Thats not what i said but okay schlomo
Being alone isn't the problem. Being **forever** alone is the problem.
Now the 'fun' really starts. :(
Ah true blue love
Brutal. I'm so sorry.
You clearly don't have a clue about [NAME] career so don't start worrying about it now.
I hope his pants fell down from the extra weight lmao
I don’t think you understand selling at a loss
CUE THE MUSIC!!!
Ok. Believe what you want. Have fun starving to death.
Yeah that's where my eyebrow went up. The liability issues alone would make it a non-starter.
"Wow, pulling her by her hair and throwing her on the ground doesn't exactly say ""respect me"" in any way."
McDonalds without sauce is just sad... you take away my garlic mayo and my barbecue sauce and you take away my soul
BITCH HER PROMO EVEN DID SCREAMS LIKE A WINNER!!!!
lakers bout to get KAT fucked now
>It'd be good for Venezuela That's the hallmark of U.S. invasions; invaded countries always do well as a result. /s
Lol, exactly what a failure would say.
I figured just being there is the main help. I will probably ask them as many questions as they ask me.
Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
Never heard of the artist or the song. But it sounds really great! Thank you for sharing!
I'm okay with killing babies in general. I mean, mastification is the cornerstone of my diet.
Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
No offense but...she's not pretty either so I'm confused why she'd say that car is only for ugly women.
Glad you answered your own question.
Excellent, this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you !!!
Your dog provided you undeniable evidence of type of person that you are, and you should be proud of that.
This would be cool for a kids science project about conductors and why metal is such a good conductor
Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
Wow, I love the car ride idea. Thanks for sharing that!
[NAME] looked like he was having a heart attack the entire game... welcome to the madhouse lol
I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick
Because they are idiots.
I am sorry human being :(
Haha that literally made me laugh out loud OMG I'm still dying. Take this upvote man. Well deserved
Actually i barely remember any threads about him getting to rank 1 in recent years. Most of them were about his insane winrates against gold-plat players.
Ya shitty. But people cheat. I dont know what to tell you 🙃 the world sucks. Just live your life
they're called queens for a reason, fuck democracy
I already did
[NAME] would laugh and hang up if this was the offer
This is so scary. Keep safe! I would put fencing up and become a licensed carrier at that point. Sounds like crazy druggies!
Stupid theory!
And you can't really see the bottom part so that's probably small too. Really grosses me out
Honestly, this would creep me out a bit.
no, the epilogue has one ending.
> 333 Brothers and sisters are here now So much cringe.
Not really, I’m not too sure, thanks for asking 
I don’t think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk
If it's not too late, I'd love to have one of the binders!
Thank you bot.
"Makeup existed in 2009 too. Whoever made this is stupid. I hate the whole ""milinials dumb"" shit."
My thoughts exactly. Love me some malicious compliance.
It's sad, but yes, zero. 
oops, my bad.
You’re being downvoted for making a moronic comment - not for your “heroic” efforts here fedora...
It's not cool that so many are going without pay and unable to make rent or buy groceries. Is a travesty that a manufactured crisis has come to this
I may have awful taste, i would want this cake
The local council is gonna have fun removing all those dodgy fillings.
No hate TGR I love you
i would feel really uneasy knowing i can never visit other countries, i think i would rather have the 50K
> [NAME] My god we have to stop with some of these advanced statistics, it’s legit getting ridiculous. 
I literally, like, hate people like that.
that would be so cool!!!!
I genuinely don't think he is. Those features with a friendly smile or a cheeky grin, backed up by a good personality could totally get it.
Ah man this video has everything, drama, action, a tiddy poppin out
I appreciate the fact that you used your precious time to translate the meme in Latin.
Man that’s cool, I like this sub. You’re a cool mod
Thank you for helping me realize that p&r bloopers is exactly what i need right now
yeah but we really don’t want to be like them. it is an example of failed communism turned militaristic authoritarianism
If there’s a pattern, yes.
felt that so hard too
When are people going to learn that it's OK to cheer lead dance in front of an old misogynist lol
I think it's your choice that determines it
Both directions? They should all be arrested. This will cost the people of Edmonton a lot of time and money. Fuck these pricks.
as someone who doesn't wear a kippa at work out of concern for these things happening....what was being said? And thank you for standing up.
Not delusional at all imo
I liked the Japandroids for that one year
Can’t argue with that.
Lol ahh man this made me laugh so hard. That filled my laugh gauge for the day.
> I can give you a mouthful... Kinky.. Lol
Yeah truly ugly people never post their pics on rateme subs.
I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you.
hit or miss would anybody care or miss huh..? aint nobody love me and ma dad also left me yuh...
Strong and handsome*
Look at CBG as well. It's got anti inflammatory properties. Wifey feels its the best medicine for her cramps.
Lol let me do you one better, what FPS games have EVER had built in aim assist with controller on pc?
Oooooooooo that’s a sweet format, love it. Thanks! 
Even one second gets you killed against focus fire, especially if you're discorded, which is almost always in this meta. 
Morocco sucks, I don’t blame you for not wanting to go
Makes me want to eat ass
I cant help it if i dream abt it damn
That's adorable!
"Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
This is it thank you so much
I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
[NAME] will be the 2nd best player in Juve team now.
"I just want to shake her by her shoulders and be like ""*Why are you like this?!*"""
I had so many bad Supercuts haircuts that I cringe when I look at the place and go to a fancy schmancy salon exclusively.
This was so helpful! Thank you. I really needed to hear something inspiring for once, instead of just hearing that I’m not doing enough.
Sorry, should have searched for the artist's name. Karma Decay is a lot less reliable than I thought it was.
loving the salah hate
Yeah, I don't blame you! Anything to keep a shred of sanity. 
Uhh...weird flex but ok?
I'm pretty sure you killed me. I got killed by a pounder on a plane on that very same map 2 days ago or so lol
I feel the same but I don't think it would be easy.
"You called me a troll and a liar and you're surprised that I sound ""antagonist and confrontational""? Wow, you're impressive. Good talk."
oh wow never heard of that in my life sorry
[NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
Happy Cake Day 5makes10fm! Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true.
Yeah cuz they don't exist lol
Very interesting. Thx
Oh fucking come on
Why not touch them? then don't shove people out of lifts. that's hardly civil. just WAIT and let people get off.
You're championing the removal of some threads while complaining about the removal of threads...
so cute
You are oddly defensive about a random chef. Did you come to /r/wewantplates just to insult people and build up this chef? [NAME]
Most important!!! ALWAYS AIM THE HEAD! [NAME] arrows are pretty fat woodsticks, so keep aiming on the head on long distance. Thats it
I'll take the Akot 3 but man that shot is ugly
Man I'm sad, he was my favorite [NAME] when he left ([NAME] heir apparent) and I was ecstatic when he returned
Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too
I find porn disgusting and boring, could this be a sign I'm asexual?
I love /r/LazyMan
It is crazy and another reason I treat going to the states with caution lol
Ok this New England accent not so fun!!
That's really the only standard of your life, whether or not it makes liberals furious? Sad.
Hell yeah. I'm really just thinking about the irony and double standard of the Left. It's amazing that these people are that cognitive dissonant.
Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow.
He isn't unique to that. Every defensive metric disagrees 🤔
Lol this happened literally 5-10 seconds after the screenshot was taken too
I can’t imagine choosing McD’s over Banh Mi, that’s just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds.
9. Some of us just don’t like fucking dogs. Fuck off. Stay away from me.
Thank you. Hugs to you too
I understand just so hard feels like I’m being thrown away like trash I don’t want to imagine a life without her in it
You can't demand historical accuracy 'at all' then. It's logical fallacy.
Everyone’s a god damned critic. Try doing five minutes of stand up and see if you don’t end up on this sub.
can't wait to catch me one of them suckers
This is irrelevant to what we were talking about.
No, that isn't possible. Discord hosts the call, which means any attempt at using wireshark would just show Discord's information, not yours.
Yes he is a very good pup check out his insta if u want its in the post
Because this creep wanted to put his hands on the girl.
Thank you, I've been looking for this forever.
Omg just drink some water then bro lol
Quite the blasé article.
Happy cake 🎂 day!
> Killing an intruder in your home in self defense is now a really bad thing. That was not even under discussion.
When I went on a first date I only took like 2 bite of my food. Felt pretty bad
I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. 
She already is. The darling that WTA so badly needed with the talent to back
Not [NAME]. He really didn’t seem like the Canuck players that played with him missed him at all.
How is that sarcasm lol just feels like you’re backpedaling
Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something.
"Maybe it needs to be ""Hall of Shame"" instead of a museum."
Very sad news for the man. Widespread travel disruption is expected for the evening commute
Better love big “snowflake” hearts!
[NAME] I LOVE YOU
Sorry I am foreign, and might have come across wrong. Anyways it has to happen at some stage?
I would feel similarly, but I would be more gleeful and less guilty. 
No, that's not standard, it's a common house rule (and is often published in the instructions as an alternate rule as well).
Very well put
Sick of that stupid floss dance
Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
Guilty Gear actually did that before with Guilty Gear Isuka. It was, uh...not good. Really fuck-awful, actually. 
I absolutely love DCfC!
Just learn from this and move on bro. Give yourself time to mourn.
This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. 
Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
Hahaha, that's a good one. 
this is cute
I love [NAME]. But I’m not sure there is a single player in he nba who he can guard
Except [NAME], he somehow defies any common sense and sometimes he comments here.
That backfired in the most delightful way.
Ah there it is
Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest 
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
Yes I wish more people did this!
This is truly terrifying.
haha I didnt remember that Rampage was there live commentating for that one, good stuff. 
French fried when he should have pizza'd and had a bad time.
Thank you! I agree. We’ve decided to back off. No need in feeding into it. :-)
I watched that game while coming down from a shrooms trip. [NAME] was magic. Still wear his jersey to shinny :D
Yep, same here. Got way too excited, then logical part of my brain kicked in. 
"Because he's an anti-science fool, like other irrational ""environmentalists""."
Fock I cant breathe.
You're willing to lie about anything to shill for [NAME].
Looks like complete slop with 4 turds thrown on top. 🤢
No it’s not, I can give you multiple examples of cops getting physically assaulted and not even using their guns. Stop lying.
[NAME] is the name I heard speculated on, but the reality is it'll be [NAME]. 
"""[NAME], meet [NAME]"" love that show"
what a great idea.. i suggest they use it to insulate all the homes of the [NAME] administration and of [NAME]!!
You’re a vet; you at least WERE poor lol. I’m a vet too dude I know the struggle.
"You are like 2 years away from being Mr [NAME].... ""eeeeexcellent"""
Great sign! We’ll get them next year!!
That's awesome to hear :)
Sorry, I swapped back to Canada unclearly, to respond to the comments about it.
Better late than never sadly I can see another label scooping him up
Yes, that is correct. I knew what you meant though:)
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes... looks like she braced before impact. Probably gets this shit all the time. 
Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck
It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
I think it doesn't have to be only in school, but anyway, good attitude, I'm sure you can overcome it (with patience)
He probably got hurt making the video
The Magic are good at being frustrating.
PEOPLE LIKE THING AGGRESSIVELY BE PROUD OF IGNORANCE
"if it's ""unavailable"" it's deffo not from the cold lol :D"
You don't go to college to learn. You go to college to have sex with college girls.
It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
I’m sorry to hear that. When do you graduate?
Yes! He’s back LOOCH!
I like that idea!
I hope you find him, but WHY didn't you exchange numbers???
You are very pretty. You also seen to have good taste in popsicles, that looks delicious.
By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME].
Purple are lowkey great value properties.
You want to fix them. You can’t. This was a hard life lesson for me to learn. I also am a giant loser magnet.
Sorry, is Russia depicted in the cartoon?
Please tell me your shop didn't get you in trouble for that D:
me as fuck
I loved how proud [NAME] looked
I’m sorry to hear this. Live a hell of a life for your mate
I regret that I have but one upvote to give for your post. Very powerful.
Well, she was completely and utterly heartbroken. By my stupidity. So there's that.
It could also be that coupledom is the wrong way to live for OP.
Had she gone into the left shoulder before braking she may have had a chance.
[NAME] is there anything more depressing than being in a leafs gdt when the leafs are losing.
You have no legs to stand on to accuse me of such.
oh shit u meant the actual post... yeh i live in china this all we got😂😂
It's hard to make friends. :( I sit alone.
That arena announcer is irritating.
Fuck me daddy
Well glad she got out of the situation safely. I would much rather NOT have to investigate and know someone is safe.
dang... that's just crazy.
Ooh I like that one :)
and now i went there...and got ragey and stabby LOL wtaf is wrong with people?! obviously, rhetorical question...but wtaf
Love this guy. I think he will end up being super good this year.
[NAME] as if he wouldn't just cut the bullet in half
I just came out of the restroom after crying from laughter watching that and my brother asked me if everything is okay
Maybe concerned about you being underweight? She is probably concerned you don’t eat enough and is trying to help you
Absolutely. I'd love it. No matter how much I like the guy, if he just goes for it that's not cool.
Reading this made me clutch my nipples in pain
Even though I'm not the poster thanks for this, I had no idea it was a thing. I'm going to check it out.
Yes! Love me rotties!
Especially hard last night looking at Snapchat stories.
Unfortunately, on the stupid official Reddit mobile app it doesn’t work. I miss my Android and Reddit Is Fun app
wow so almost every sub has grown a lot in 7 months. Also 8.3k!! what!? that's insane
Worst CB we’ve had in recent memory
I’m scared to fall asleep——-
They’re not just investments. They’re deliberately exploitative and China’s not operating in good faith
thanks, my roommate is a photographer so props to her 😂😂
Woman here - $50 per orgasm please! I could easily make $300 in a half hour wankfest...
jokic with a couple dumb arm fouls already, he seems a tad unsettled
What the fuckkkkk burn itt
LOL THEY DIED? like if you get reference
Looks fade, having a partnership with people that love and care about each other doesn't have to.
I wish my nickname was [NAME]
It says I love to make myself laugh
[NAME]. growing some ladyburn1974 as part of my first grow. thank you!
It will probably take him some time to figure out whether he’s really ok with it or not.
Thanks. I’m not sure your response is a proper attempt at answering the question.
Enjoy you Salad
Amazing. Professional athletes doing what they're paid to do.
No. It doesn't. And a moron on Reddit has no authority to say that it does.
You do right, if you don't care then fuck 'em!
Captain you ARE wrong. You’re wrong nooption to argue. I have the final rule ! Nope not gonna listen.
We're worse to animals than we were 100 years ago, js.
This hurts me.
I’ve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
Lopez is a better rim protector but I get your point
I hate my life
Happy cake day !
tailing... BOL!
These Red Dead Redemption graphics are amazing
What an effort! Lets Go Pens!
[NAME] does more than [NAME] so I'll have do disagree about that
Cheers, guys! We are never drinking alone when we are here! But in person, I love drinking alone. 
Definitely didn’t give [NAME] a huge scar
I sure hope this dog is reunited with its family. It is one of the cutest dogs I’ve seen, a very unique looking pup!
I love everything I have ever made in mine, but recently it's mostly used to hard boil eggs.
[NAME] is my favorite character so I’m super happy they did what they did and I’m very happy she used her semblance, finally. 
Sorry about that!
Congrats bud! Hope it was a good 21st!
[NAME] you are a freak.
Damn hippies.
Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better.
terrifying every time.
Hooray! ...But I'll still never be able to afford a home.
True. I'm just glad I didn't have to go through my high school years we the her...
The ID cards wouldn't have been a problem if they were like the EU one. It was the fuckload of biometric data that was abhorrent.
I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.
That’s Grandpa [NAME]. I stomp flaming bags with my boots
Oh that's so sad
"This a very serious question but I will say what everyone else will: ""I want [NAME] out"""
They didn't play it safe. They played it big and failed hard. The plot is too damn big for a soft-reboot game.-* +
You post your pics online. Good for you! You're probably not a subhuman
liberals are filthy animals
It shouldn’t say that, because it is not single payer 
Stop texting him until you meet him. What if he is weird, creepy, not your type etc. 
I love [NAME] so much, but honestly it's great news that they refused to go back to that system. Hoping for [NAME].
You just going into the posse menu and buy the persistent posse. It costs $200. Good luck ❤️
Watched it last night and as someone not generally into supernatural horror/thriller type stuff, I thought it was pretty damn enjoyable. 
"Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
All of the ones regular people have, just applied in a more logical way I guess. 
I love taking my girlfriend to Victorias Secret, we shop together, and the whole experience is a kind of foreplay. I highly suggest that route.
Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think...
the older me would be scared shirtless knowing all the fireworks that exploded nearly in my hand as a kid
this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones
I read this is the voice of [NAME]. Great job with the narration!
Your old enough to call the police. Don't let him put hands on you again.
He looks proud of his work, leave him be.
How do you hire the former DA? That sounds super helpful...
I hope she wins next week
Not this sub’s fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots
*Bud Light presents...real men of genius. 🎶 Mr Take Your Cat Up Tiger Mountain On Your Shooooulderrrrr* 🎶 
If you’re talking about 玛雅, I checked and they’re permanently closed. It’s a shame since the location would have been perfect.
Ladies and Gentlemen........We got him
[NAME] lesnar. Sorry [NAME]
Insurance covers stupid.
No, you're thinking of basilisk. A basterisk is a person born outside of wedlock.
I didn’t say for how long I’d been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!
Thank you 😁
I love when they send in the wrong meat, it’s only happened to me once,
It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
It's cute to hear that teens are still having mall dates--I thought those died out 15 years ago.
She’s a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers. :(
same, just found it interesting and sent it so people could see. 
That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess...
Aight thanks bro for the insight
[NAME] is so cute ^_^, the second bunny image is my favourite. Since you haven't got any requests... I request Himiko.
? sometimes i play ffa with my friends to have fun
Not even getting my hopes up at all. Story of our life- Padres fan.
It's true though. He either gets no shirt and freezes to death or wears a stupid looking butchers cape. I hope he gets something better next season
Best! Episode! Ever! There is like a joke every 20 seconds.
You know what happens when we make assumptions!!! Good point. Thank you.
I regret that I understand that reference :(
In 10 years, she’s still be a loser.
I feel like this happens to me every single time I shop there. I dont go in anymore because I'm tired of being followed.
"I do that anytime I see something pointy. I'm just like, ""I wonder how it would feel to stab my eye with that."
“hurrrr mumble crap sucks so much u cant understand what they saying wheres all the lyrical spiritual miracle individual biblical rhymes smh”
Good on you dude. I'm west coast, but I'd love if anyone ever finds themselves in Seattle, I extend this offer.
Miss you...
Ahem. There are those who think that life Has nothing left to chance A host of holy horrors To direct our aimless dance
"""I will not return to those wretched mines!"""
I like long hair but it's never been a huge consideration in love.
Since our newest addition to this holiday I've included a new, fun tradition where you hide a yellow toupee inside of the president's tree.
I thought it may be the industry, but based on other people’s answers here, I’m not so sure :/ 
>It is tailored to your viewing history. That's fairly common knowledge nowadays isn't it? Weird thing for the comic to point out.
I'd love him to get a pick6/scoop and score and chief slam on them
No it's laziness. People don't clean because there isn't an immediate consequence and the reward for cleaning isn't large enough.
Anti-Vaxer mom: This isn’t supposed to happen, they weren’t supposed to live this long.
This isn’t a “someone” this is a company.
He had better get 1st ballot. He's a legend.
Dude my brother just paid $300 for an ounce, can’t wait for legalisation
She sucks but you don’t sound much better
Thanks. That's a handy resource. My question remains unanswered.
[NAME] is awesome
Meh, I'm actually pissed at some of the people I usually defend for getting excited about this too.... we did lose our data.
you'd have a point if the only use of a car was to kill people.
Oh damn, it’s gonna hunt me down. 
Please don't think the way they're trolling represents us [NAME]. I'm sorry this happened.
This shark is so beautiful i thought it was one of those high quality animations
I like how you ignored the point about Blade Runner.
Less is definitely more. That picture is just kind of forgettable old meme material. This post feels like old keyword stuffing.
Additional space race
I didnt realize wishing Liberty would open their wallet would make it happen... It sucks, but it's the reality. We need value.
Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂
I *want* to like R&M but people are making it really difficult
[NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy.
No its an edited one by someone on this sub, I can't find it though. 
Oh man, there isn't enough popcorn to enjoy this.
Good riddance. [NAME] needs to focus on a healthier mindset and lifestyle (not extreme veganism) and find some happiness.
It's so much worse with a child involved. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
My favorite [NAME] post-match celebration hands down.
I like the assignments.
I wanted to slap her when she told him she could have died and it would be his fault.
YES! And have some fun guests to dish with.
Not true. Our knowledge of it is derived from the fossil record, which is geological.
I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.
Haha imagine if that limo in Vancouver where him, [NAME], and [NAME] were shirtless had a dash cam.
I don't care anymore.
Thank you. [NAME]
I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN
Huh. Siege is still a thing. I miss the old days. :(
I love Fate too. I hope you have a great life and that everything goes the way you want it to.
This is a very good meme op but I hope you're doing good:)
I appreciate your meme OP.
So nice of everyone to welcome [NAME] to his rehab like this.
Alright, thanks again
i’m running, hiding & avoiding this man. poor girl. her story is a sad one 
thank you maybe its just best if i forget it.
Good guy for real.
I am serious, and don't call me [NAME].
I thought he was trolling oops
Ooof girl...I thought this was satire at first it was so cringe.
He’s a brave man.
Those subs ... wtf
Aw no. Don't tell me you are out of epic quips to rek the trumpist incel fascist nazi?
Glad to see people actively calling out yet another asshole on here pretending to want to help people. Good show!
your joke sucks
Great trade for us but we're losing some forward depth in [NAME]. Tbh though I would be willing to take the risk.
Especially since he did well last season outside of Yankee stadium.
Everything on the internet is real and serious... Im here to be downvoted and laugh.
She represents window licking retards.
Fuck this guy
So TD tried putting an invisible downvote button for real?? Didn’t stop me from downvoting their idiocy.
Looks like they did it to scare everyone else on the road as a dominance game.
Oh man, good luck man. Stay strong!
Eww that would mean creating a facebook account.
I'm going to hell for laughing.
No just take care of your body!!! Fuck that
[NAME] is a terrible writer, a raging narcissist, and not an actual friend to anyone. 
Not everyone find it meaningful, but it helped me and my friends at least :) Hope others may find it useful too
That little smile at the end is exactly why she looks fun.
This makes perfect sense, thank you for explaining! 
More insults, [NAME] said my bit now all you have is a show that proves what I said to be the truth, nothing more nothing less.
I partly disagree. In an argument that stupid, whoever writes more text than the other person is inevitably the bigger moron.
Life is Strange is terrible. Absolutely zero gameplay...
Beating OSU some how lol
Man I love that flair.
That's actually a really good one. Atleti fans also seem to love him and literally everyone who faces him despises him.
"Really love the ""Midtown Yards"" greenspace in the Mikyoung Kim design and also the Agence Ter design. "
*they were not* 😂 perfect. I’m sure they were - that mental image is pretty awesome lol
Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.
Yeah some kid in a BMW ran me off the road. I didnt just crash had some help.
Her parents are raising her to be a terrible person. Fantastic.
nice one gards!!
He was having a nice stroll through the park then BAM a wedding blindsided him
You know I’m sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he’s been really good for us overall. I still trust him.
I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
Idk I feel like it's just an exaggeration, English is a hyperbolic language
Go for it. I could use the excitement.
Looks like he's tired of your dad-jokes. Lol
“To put us all know who [NAME] laughed through it all.
And always say I love you. My SO is an officer and we ALWAYS say I love you before we leave each other.
It's hard to start over. I wish you happiness.
But he was so *hurt* when [NAME] acknowledged that homosexuality is a sin.
Thank you, I will def look that up. 
Lmao That’s a blatant lie, ~1000 people were killed by American cops last year compared to 52 cops killed by civilians 
I love your Grandma! Good for you for not just giving in.
Lol do it.. then block him again
indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly
This primary doesn’t deserve this nice birthday.
I love your collection and want to play with it! p.s. am 40
Thank you SO much! This is so genuine and so helpful. Thank you so much for your time and your thoughts.
I thought he had a cool [NAME]. Was only slightly disappointed.
Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP.
My fav time to walk around the city. Everything looks nicer to me.
Oh, a little misunderstanding, my bad.
Style of play is overrated. We spent half of the season sticking to a style of play. We should play what gives wins.
Omg. I hope she is ok! Poor [NAME].
Always down for some Liverpool love
You're right... But look at that badass black leather jacket.
That's a pretty bad example ngl lol
I know right! I was mad and then blamed myself cause he’s scared of thunder and there was a storm while I was gone.
What a great photo and you two look so happy. 😍
Yikes that made me tense up. Not sure I was breathing. 10/10. Very painful looking
Someone please send me the full episode I need to see the rest :(
That was a long read but it was worth it, good on you lot for sorting it out and winning the case
[NAME], you're back! And still posting the same old editorialized political garbage, I see. Some things never change.
Yeah I hope so! I really love her but I understand too that I can only do so much! Thank you.
It’s a shame that the name of the man doing the kicking is lost to history.
And perfectly perfect.
Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither.
Where's your helmet?! Gotta love helmets.
I have, Just i cant talk with them now, ill try to as fast as possible, thank you for your advice! 
It's crazy how far Photoshop has come. Underwater bridges?!! NEVER!!!
Shut up [NAME] we’ve had enough of experts
My wife is not allowed to flick my ears for any reason, and apparently I'm not allowed to stick my finger into her bellybutton lmao.
I mean… yeah? So glad to be at that age where the conversation would be more uncomfortable for them than for me.
[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME] + [NAME] was fun. 
Damnit, it was *Flavor-Aid*, not Kool-Aid.
Agreed. To add, we also need to see how coaching changes shake out when it's all done.
One of the very few individuals to survive a shot to the head. Very unfortunate since he had a couple of more good years ahead of him.
Usually they ask, and the generic is almost always cheaper. It's shitty of them not to ask though. 
I like it
Dude that looks like some sh*t out of a James Bond movie!
I'd be ok with this former Israeli IDF general.
I think I can agree with you here, I kinda forgot about the military.
Ugh I know it's wishful thinking but I'm praying to mayor [NAME] for a DC gov closure
We have freeish speech. If you can be prosecuted for something you say then you can't in any way that we have free speech.
oh my [NAME] that first post 🤢🤢
Nice try with your 1/3 pan and t rex arms there buckaroo /s
Thank you so so so much. Best of luck to you. We deserve the kind of live we give others.
[NAME] is both pretty and strong, I think it's a great name!
Lol every time I complain we score like 2 min later. I will wait 5 min
Sorry, I posted this first but then you said something that I wanted to acknowledge I agreed with.
Nah, I like that they come here and tell on themselves. 
You know, I didn’t have an anxiety attack all day. Thanks for ensuring it happened. 
Yeah I haven't felt anything in days. It's like I'm numb, I hate that feeling.
B-But big pharma is great! Vaccines everyone! Vaccines! We love big pharma! They never lie! Come on start circlejerking!
If it's a real challenge for you, u can help you with a ban. Then it's trivial 
I heard rumors of this. From what I understand the plan is to set off nukes to get the core spinning again. Awesome Movie Reference BTW!
Yeah I hope he can play against IU that’d be a huge loss
It means that [NAME] campaign colluded, contrary to them saying otherwise. Sorry if you voted to advance Russian interests.
I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
Oh for fuck sake. Things were going so well on the coaching front. This dude is nothing but a suck up
Hope to see you in the chat as the episode premiers! Best wishes!
He looks like he smells of cheese
I like [NAME] because she hates America
I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it
Dude, I'm happy for you. Keep going, you're doing great!
Sounds like a really bad time. Just wait till you have a nice time and place to trip.
Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
Ugh. That was not information anyone needed...
And most ironic. We created the language but people still don’t properly understand us as the mutated the damn thing
Thanks- I'll take your advice.
That moment when you can't even get mad when you realise it's another sad boring troll with nothing better to do than creating alt accounts .
Goddamn it...
Imagine that when you breath in, your lungs feel crispy, that’s what -10 feels like
Easy: he’s completely unrepresentative of Colorado and really bad at his job.
Said there must be something in the water when talking about the oilers issues
This isn't about football, [NAME] is a horrible dude.
Gotta cheat on taxes somehow LOL
You’ll just be throwing them up. Ain’t worth it.
Only thing TO know is that this motherfucker is obviously living his best birdy life and good for him. Fly high little buddy, fly high. 
Wool will stay warm even if it gets wet.
[NAME] has filled a speech bubble with savage roasts, froze it, and bashed [NAME] over the head with it. [NAME] has fucking died.
You just need to live your best life. Do the things that make you happy and don't dwell on any of the negatives.
Agree completely except that I would switch [NAME] and [NAME]
Yeah mate, was just being sarcastic. [NAME] after January is something else. But still, I'm happy for [NAME].
Oh man, the crab brigade hit this thread *hard*
SDAs are [RELIGION] tho lol
Whenever you get a smelly one, don't you feel ashamed? Like what disgusting thing did I do wrong?
For those behind stupid WaPo
I’m sorry about your friend.
Cant talk about the a***a
My son brings *homework* from kindergarten. I feel betrayed.
No, they couldn’t hav- They shouldn’t have. uh...this makes me feel sick 🤕 
Okay just thought it would be a good idea.
You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now.
I hadn’t seen it and appreciated it!
I dont own a gun. I just dont like your attitude. You read like a drugged out washed up leach.
Oh cool! I don’t drink, but I’m sure a store would have some ready to throw out or something!
You're giving fascism too much credit here. They were backed by capitalists in the first place because it was profitable. It's those two together.
If you were still here you probably heard mine! He’s a coonhound and likes to sing
I feel your pain...
Oh man, sorry to hear you’re feeling so alone. I’m feeling the same right now. 
Well, I probably would have been against the Cespedes signing if we had to sign him for 7 years. But that goes more for a pitcher.
This is my favorite wild memory
Thank you! When I have more, I'll post it.
I loved [NAME] so much
You guys are heartless, smfh.
Hopes we all get so sick of his messages we'll vote for him to outlaw them. Courageous strategy Mr [NAME]
Everybody betrayed [NAME] [NAME]. I'm fed up with this world.
Omg. This is just the best ever. 💜💜💜
Take some time to ponder why you fancy yourself intelligent when you revel in pedantry and can't even understand such a simple point.
Kill whitey!
Yeah but how is that even possible if 99% of girls who are out are with friends? That’s pretty intimidating
Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
i am. This means i will move from MTN to VODACOM. and i only roam!! Wow
> But you will probably find you are noticeably worse looking at 40 than you are at 27. Well that's disappointing.
Fuck the cubs
I love when kids get cocky and then fall / get injured. That first kid's smile and face plant is just the best.
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
The only problem with this plan is that [NAME] won’t survive that long, lol
Children taken below decks by [NAME]. Get out now
Ah yes three of my ~~best friends~~ worst enemies
Is your PC beefy? It looks like Battlefield god damn
I'm suprised I didn't see more of these. Thanks for the support :)
Agreed. Sometimes you just have to move forward and let those determined to be left behind have their wish.
>We must invade Brazil to protect the Amazon rainforest from the fascist [NAME] Retards on r/worldnews
I asked for trick candles. Thank you for the gift! What a lovely day this turned out to be!
Yes and quite alot of reasons building up. Me, people, past. I hope you will be ok.
I like how she calls him racist, when he didn’t actually say anything racist.
DWIGHT, NEVER YELL AT THE CUSTOMERS
Pressing Q everytime garrosh tries to throw someone helps tho, if u wanna play support, play like one, thanks
You. I like you.
I can’t wait for socialist Norway to collapse.
I will go back to actually read the piece in its entirely but wow. Her gray is so pretty. I’m jealous
I’m anything but little you little puppy kicker
I always just say “thank you” because it’s a nice thought 🤷‍♀️
How DARE you!
>very good teams and perfect situations Situations such as.... [NAME] at the Knicks? Lmao dude, give it up. 
Most of them seem to be joking about the walls.
She has at least 12 elbows and all of them are happy. You get it gurl
Went on a date with someone whose 8 years older than me. She didn't realize I was only 20. Whoops.
Yens are worthless. That's like, wait £10? For pants? Jfc you have a point.
I mean he's still not wrong. A traitor did bring out the worst in him then.
I love this sub so much.
And how she can’t cry bc of her “expensive lashes.” 🤦🏼‍♀️
SEVEN parrots? Wow. Bit of a hoarder there.
Why would someone need a year to respond to your needs? Don’t waste another moment.
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
The lesson is to not take 4 Ambien. That is just stupid.
Same tbh hahahaha
Stupidly stubborn / stubbornly stupid
Maybe one day we will be able to see that process. I wish. I love my pets so much 😍
I didn’t know this was a thing, thanks!
It would be funny if that guy got hit with a car at the end tho.
Can confirm, playing a game of checkers is the one occasion I get to smash my wife
When everyone is lying who are you supposed to believe ?
i say no or in da club if they come to damce with me i walk away
The truly sad thing is she's getting burned to legitimize Russiagate. It's a shame she wasn't a legit whistleblower.
Go take a shower your personality stinks
Everyone hates guys that talk shit and can't back it up, don't start shit when you suck.
Seriously. A lot of small businesses especially rely on federal work. I hope this gets solved soon.
I recomend a Jasikevicius from Litva :) Sorry for English.
Central Business District. Its where main shops are located normally in very close vicinity.
I find the joke chill and reasoned
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...
HHahah. Right? I’m scared
Omg so glad I’m not alone
Just stop.
What. The. Actual. Fuck. *Gags*
[NAME] over there kneeling in front of a picture of [NAME] riding a dinosaur thanking his savior for giving him the strength to be conniving little twat
I love this woman.
Being a broke college student doesn’t help😂 thank you for taking the time to listen though it’s really helpful lol
Purdue's worst loss is Notre Dame (93 Kenpom) New Mexico is 187 in Kenpom. Good try tho
Yea sounds like a great way to teach your children that stalking and harrassing = love. Husband only hits you bc he loves you!
This is awesome!
He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he’s not above disgusting liquids.
Aww, what was your favorite thing you did with him while you were there?
 [NAME], this isn't a guy who built the railroads here. 
2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.
Late-stage Reddit. I'm afraid it's malignant, there are only palliative care options available at this point.
"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."
Forgot to mention that it contains lanolin, don't know if thats a deal breaker. Regardless, alcohol free emollient + occlusive is the way to go
If it was super easy to get citizenship. I would love to.
Thanks for the support, yeah my dad has been trying to make me feel a little better.
Damn, I want some! 
I want this feature just so I can get rid of the nasty rugged beige skins people have on their guns
"Without fail saying ""moist panties"" makes every woman cringe."
[NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
I’d go at [NAME] every possession. He is so tired out there
Really glad you were there for her. I wish you both the best.
I don't have a problem with this if their hands are clean.
Bold of you to assume just about everyone here wouldn't do this for you, you absolute gem
Thank you for correcting me on these! I have taken them down. I will do more research in the future.
I really don’t want the I told you so moment to ever arrive. 😔
That's...not at all what I said. I said I *hoped* they would tell me. [NAME].
Don't attend. Don't engage. They want validation, don't give it to them.
Thanks DB, I'll see if I can find the book
Nice language 👏
* Fuck [NAME] * Yes
Thanks for the response!
I wanted Dallas to win today so they could lose next week. I don’t want LA anywhere near the Super Bowl.
Damn, you're good a parkour. That was a pretty giant leap to be made.
My favorite [NAME] and she was awesome as [NAME]. I also loved her playing the opposite [NAME] to [NAME] in DS9.
[NAME] I hope that isn’t the release date. I’m holding out for 12am EST 🤞
6 months is not long term in my opinion. 2 years and up.
Oh cannot do anything ... click pass so much fun:) Not yet pass all 3 lanes :)
You sound like a great mum
Given that you're not a conservative and this isn't a debate sub, how about you just get the hell out and stay out.
it made me cry too when [NAME] return to her older self😢
It’s my favorite Saturday movie, never gets boring
Lol he said it was the driver's fault and everyone called him out.
Wimbledon’s instagram posted about [NAME] and his relationship with the Open and I ended up crying. Not ready for him to hang it up
I am getting so nervous watching this
Nope, not really
$1200 gets you a hell of a nice mortgage on a home.
People are idiots....sheep don't magically become independent thinkers just because their food source changes
No he was given a bad team to work with unfortunately, and never got the final shot he deserved :(
Thank you for the advice. I was thinking it was envy, and I needed some place to get advice from some strangers.
I heard [NAME] makes someone his bitch on a usual basis. Anyone remember how often?
Couldn't have said it better. Just did the same over my winter break and really got to know myself a lot better. Cheers to the new year!
Thank you! <3
As a killer main that sounds like bs, and makes me even more likely to treat 3v1 as a fun round
No steel toe boots either. Amateurs. If the owner made his cooks do this instead of proper contractors he deserves a workers comp claim.
Alright, thanks
It sounds like you project a lot of anger...maybe letting things go, relaxing and slowing down is your solution.
I resent being lumped in with the group you are referencing, but thanks for sharing.
This joke made me want to walk right out of the Dumbledoor.
She has started therapy with an addiction specialist. That is a hopeful sign IMO. Wish she had started a while ago.
I love this story. So much.
Agreed but I’ll still take kpins if they’re available
I need to know the backstory on this!
I could go, but honestly, it is the worst place on earth. I have 0 desire to do it.
Sorry you feel that way
I feel like this anime will make me cry in the end. Damn even its opening is full of drama. Am I correct in this?
[NAME], Thank you!
This same problem exists in playground as well.
That is absurd, man. I'm sorry you don't believe in the spirit realm. 
Thanks. I'm in the same boat about being against therapy. Good luck to you too.
Easy, stop men from fucking them. Cant be a slut if no one fucking ya right?
Rape kit test from six year old migrant girl revealed DNA from 30 men.
That poor soul
[NAME] what the hell is going on at hq
Good luck buddy!
Don't worry dude. The ladies could never see it if you remain to be a virgin and keep your pants up.
That escalated quickly.
Water is not a human rights. That's absurd.
Preach. The nuthuggers and happy go lucky blind sheep if the front office are nowhere to be found. So disappointed in this team.
It was indeed , but holy shit is that cheap and [NAME] :3
Came here looking for the knowitall that explains the difference. Disapointed in reddit today.
I have been doing that. The disc-to-digital thing is pretty sweet.
It's too bad they don't use that gorgeous high altar.
And their cats. IT loves kittens.
so abused...
I'm so jealous!
You're a tenant if you lived there for months and that was an unlawful eviction.
Ur actually stupid lol.
the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]
Me too, I'm shitting myself.
Pff sticking the bumper back on isn’t a massive task, I’d call it a win 
At some angles you can get a ws4 into a combo but its inconsistent.
Let's get petty! Love it
Leave ASAP. That is all. Your life will be better for it
I love happy endings.
Something something don't fight what you hate, save what you love.
Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle
"Holy shit. I remember sleeping on the back window ""ledge"" in my parents' car! I haven't thought about that in years."
Bad news dude. You're almost 100 years past that.
I remember saying [NAME] messed up the timeline worse than [NAME] over a year ago
Hahahaha!! I was thinking the exact same thing. But you could really feel the excitement while reading! 10/10
Its weird because I didn’t say “house cat” I just said “cat” yet you felt the need to correct me.
Didn't find it believable even from the start
Sounds like my kind of place.
That was so fun!! 😂😂😂👌👌👌🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥😎😎
I couldn't agree more.
A joke is subjective pal, second of all you need to mature/grow up and get a taste of the real world before giving your political opinions.
Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him
Walmart is a special kind of hell.
I think you should be able to, with enough skill and precision but not in a spam swing fight, I agree.
"""I love ya, Mom"". Man, if I was his mom I'd knock him into next week."
NOLA is a terrible place to live, ran by democrats forever and this is the result. 
As a closing TM, that’s terrifying. 
> You could probably argue that they'd be fine with giant steaks and BBQ Pretty sure I mentioned it.
Good bot lol
He's been cheered for years now.
It depresses me that the Carousel revamp has been a popular answer. Thats not a change, that a sliding scale adjustment.
Well that's because you're close-minded. But meh. I don't need your respect. ;)
It gives me a weird feeling as someone not named [NAME]. It's a very heeby jeeby inducing phrase.
I’ve read your comment over and over and I’m sorry I can’t parse what you’re saying.
I second that motion...with A VENGEANCE!!
Amazing. Roasted sweet potatoes as well are dynamite
Thank [NAME] this was said, I feel 100% the same way. 
Thank you my friend
Thanks for your insight
[NAME] wrote a really technical and really awesome article in the Athletic about this game. Holy shit haha worth reading if you are a ball nerd.
Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better
Human produce bad carbon dioxide too We should EAT OURSELVES ️
At least he tried
Love hearing stories like this. [NAME] holy Priests are such a gift. We must always give thanks and pray for them.
This is actually really good! Thanks for posting this man!
And you know they never grow out of that...I hate people. Myself included.
Thank you .. I wish I was religious.. I admire religion... My mind just doesn't want to believe..
Break up? Lol you lost me right there. I thought you were a rational dude until the mourning your “break up”. Decent troll 6/10
3:08am and my laughter has now turned into wheezing sobs
shouldve just given him the sum you usually pay and transfer the burden of awkwardness onto him
I never said prostitution doesn't exist. I said it is off the streets.
This is ok as extra content, but it feels really uncomfortable.
No problem! I’m glad we can help. Hope it goes well
Gives me [NAME] 2005 bad memories.
Yeah, that's why I'm not feeling like there's much I can do except vent.
PLEASE leave my Mother out of this!
Not incel related
Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
I like [NAME]. He's the most experienced, and he seems like an all-around nice guy.
For the love of [NAME] stop making him relevant. Please.
Same here man, terrible feeling
You are reduced to attacking men for their biology.
I kill him before he kills me during the date
I have started my 30 day vacation and I plan on relaxing the whole 30. Please do not make plans for me. Discuss them first with me.
Hope you're havin a good trip my dude! Good vibes ✌🌈
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE.
I'm so sorry for your loss. One of my favourite unisex names is [NAME].
Allowed to, sure. Just don't expect me to provide you lube. And don't complain to me when you start chafing.
Looks like pretty much any Donkeys fan.
How dare you disrespect [NAME].
There where over 40000 stabbings in the UK last year, and this guy reckons these “kids” are just acting tough 😬
Thanks for the tip. Just sold 100K
Thank you, I'll try that. And yes I'll definitely thank her if I see her again.
#OMG TERRIFYING!!!!
Some additional background the robo-voice on that video is horrible.
Thanking people isn't manly.
It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at
It's rape after they've both consented? You're what's wrong with society today, try to be less of a dipshit going forward.
Suck Fat Women.
I don't believe you
You don't look at accidents on the road? Yeah, I don't believe you.
M/21/straight/6’2 Back on tinder after taking a year off dating to focus on personal stuff. Go ahead and judge! Thank you in
Pretty sure it was a joke bud
it will be the compilation of 3 games, don't get your expectations that high.
Nah man presses, but good ones... the pharma kalmas are long gone bro, here in Australia anyway
I love how he misses that last punch when he goes down lol. Like, thats when the liver shot really sunk in
No, I was very interested in the game until this news broke. Now I’m a little disappointed. But at least I can opt-out. 
It’s getting so annoying
Wow, impressive... And how long until it breaks and they decide it's not worth repairing?
It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone
Are you ghosting?
This is the kinda stuff that is cute in romantic comedies. It just depends on how much you like him.
Even if you don't act on them, you still should stay away. It's not normal to fantasize about doing sexual things to children.
That's a rather annoying extrapolation of what I said.
"""Oh no, my blue heroes died, it's probably very bad, time to concede""."
I’m disappointed that no one has suggested taking her up Oxo Tower yet.
I had one of those... my cat broke it.
Yeah she looks like a real [NAME]!
He has become that which he swore to destroy!
We need our damn OL coach...he was amazing this year.
Not sure how you could put [NAME] there, he's been our worst defender 
Which makes it even weirder that he hasn't played [NAME] yet. He seems born for that role.
Yeah, sorry I don't know British or Canadian.
Too late, you read it anyways. Ban me if you don't want to read more. Lmao!! 
That as absolutely insane.
Im loving these DBS and canuck meme mixtures
Palms had a rough game against PHL. Seems a bit off lately.
YES PLEASE... I thought they did a while back but maybe not. Either way, they should! Very annoying.
What did you use to kill them all? Sorry I’m kinda a noob
Good job shining up your spine and telling him it's over! Your life is going to get so much better with him not dragging you down.
I switched to Ally and love it. 2.2% interest is awesome
It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material
"As if any of those words mean anything other than ""give me what I want or I'll socially shame you!"""
Wasnt meant to be rude at all.. more like that everything is going to be alright soon
Your cat is the best thing I've read all day. Take care of your cat!
This sounds like fainting. Get your blood pressure/sugars checked.
Willpower. I have a lot of little compulsions I give into. Time to gain control over my day to day.
ASK HER OUT FOR COFFEE OR SOMETHING ALREADY! And while i wish things go well for you with her, next time dont wait for so many signals.
This time next year, this game will be praised. The current installation will be ridiculed in its place. Its been this way for years 
Well he gets an A+ for fackin over the people!
Why don't Maroon 5? Regardless of the quality of the song, its been one of the most popular songs for the past 8 months
"""PETA approved"" I'm out. I hate PETA even more than I hate mlms"
Clean your room before daddy [NAME] gets home.
Your dad is awesome
Being adorable mostly
0% But then again most of us on here aren't placing top 8 at majors so that could factor in
It's my birthday today, so thank you, I guess? I hope something nice happens to you too.
I took swimming lessons for a while and my fingerprint thing didn't work for months
A Reddit couple! That's good to hear, hope yous stay safe :)
Nice one comrade
Alright, I really wanted you to go to HR but it might not go right for you
What’s the chemical make up of a word? Yea thought so genius lmfaoooooo.
Well new years eve people can hit it with some luck in my area haha
I was waiting for the delayed explosion and holy cow! That was insane!
holy shit I got mad at those 4 points you made [NAME], playing [NAME] like that would be literally hell.
If hes married and a decade down the road and tells her im sure itll be nothing more than a great laugh lol
Sometimes you gotta hate living to love life ya feel?
r/vaxxhappened. Fuck you Jan.
Honestly thought they were the same thing, thanks for the correction and the expansion of my terrible vocabulary.
I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive.
Suppressing anger is a horrible idea. You want to dissipate it in some healthy way, not bottle it up.
Hmm, I understand your frustration then
Yeah, sorry, I was on the mobile site, and wasn't able to delete it.
I swear of all the people that dislike artifact, the gwent crew is by far the most obnoxious.
I see it this way also. I have never played Pokemon Go but I feel like DD creates the same excitement.
You're right but ”just be confident” (I know that you didn't say it ) is really hard when you're unattractive
30 Rock is the best. I'm currently on my 1st rewatch of The Office and it's still just as good as I remember it.
"Very well said. I am no fan of pinkers ""everything is awesome"" narrative of the modern world either."
For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks
I didn't get it the first time, thank you for replying me.
Only Ten more minutes of watching [NAME] drop easy ass throws
Nice to see someone actually posted something useful here. :D Thanks!
This is terrifying
Must be nice my seats were in that area... sadly I decided to go to the bathroom. #PTSD
We've been bamboozled
I could not agree with you more! These selfish women crying abuse to manipulate.
>[NAME] pulls publicity drama stunt with mild success. FTFY
I LOVE WALNUT CREEK
That might’ve been the worst pass he’s ever thrown. Yikes
I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!
And completely daft
YES! I can't recommend this TED Talk enough and I think it's really disappointing that many portions of the left have caved in to anti-nuclear hysteria.
Good video, friend
I wish for world peace!
did you just use a gendered term I don't know. It just looks cute to me.
Reality is often disappointing -TPUSA, probably 
Misandry is not part of our feminism here. Don’t make such comments again.
>he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
Haha damn this put a huge smile on my face! Good job on handling that situation. This almost deserves it's own post!
Dude it was an old video. Your porn math is way off.
I don't know about that. Old Liz managed to earn around $90k over the past couple of years.
I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain?
Boiled peanuts are my happy food.
> my cat needs new braces, Thank you. This made me laugh.
Article says she was present when this happened sometimes and that she was physically and psychologically abusive as well
People there are great citizens out there who dislike Rick & Morty studies) should be legalized already.
Omw. When my man sends me that I get all warm and excited cuz I know I get to spends the next couple hours or days with him
They're not. They're rolling super hard. And loving it!
MmMm I love me some microplastics.
Happy cake day!
You're most welcome!
The NHL has the best All-Star events. the 3v3 tournament is so fun to watch.
Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
Smoking is nasty.
Dude you’re right but just because we draft someone in the 1st round doesn’t guarantee a starting caliber QB.
> Basically tell them to screw off and realize their selfishness You mean my grandparents / aunt?
I like how it's also a subtle girls>guys
No man. Door wins!
I am more of a dumbass for building a $2500 308 AR-10 for my first rifle... regret it but just not willing to sell it till this day
It's holiday time here in Europe. Today is my first day in work for 2 weeks.
I'm cautiously optimistic about him.
Not true at all
Indeed it does. I blame [NAME] and his love of sponsorships.
Perfect World was my first mmorpg that I played for years. Super fond memories of the game.
The amount of Islamophobic media bias is disturbing.
Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet.
I'm lost here
[NAME] I didn't know this reddit, the comments are wonderful.
Keep yourself occupied go play videogames or something that really occupies your attention
. The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
Salaam, these thoughts happen. It is the shaitan trying to divert you from the path. May [NAME] grant you patience and the steadfastness to protect yourself.
"> When did I ever mention native genocide? How do you think the land was ""stolen""? The residents were killed."
love that the block against AZ is in this. what a year for Kittle.
I wish I could get this kind of funny stuff sent to me on Snapchat. All I ever get are bobs and vagene.
I love this idea
No problem here, as long as neither one of you are the asshole.
I'm just thinking our government sucks at Civilizations. Should have invaded them decades ago. Lots of water and farm land to use.
I just hope a GM believes in [NAME] as much as this Raptors fan. Maybe [NAME] could give us something valuable to get this future MVP back.
I just bought these, they look amazing! Thank you, Internet parent! 
Edgy bro.
TBH I was worried he actually hurt [NAME]. Glad everyone is ok.
I hope so too, she deserves it.
It's been deleted, we can't even see what it was now (unfortunately). 
Lol, get em Corsi! 
I’ll try to follow your advice. Thank you very much for your kind answer and your prayer. I’ll pray for you too.
But people already know I'm weird.
Thanks everyone for your feedback! Dosing one bottle tomorrow night around 8pm EST, will post back with results 🤠
Weird! Also in Winnipeg, no issues. Do you have a VPN?
Thank you, you're awesome
No, I definitely understand that feel and empathize. That can be hard to deal with. How have you been as of late?
Every time I see a something like, 'thanks for nothing, [NAME],' I mentally apologize to her, lol. 
And it’s super awkward with someone you barely know.
Yes, but you don't need it to play.
He posts on The_Donald, you're arguing with a brick wall
We gotta keep our hopes up sometime.
I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
As quick as possible? I wish. 2 hours and 9 minutes I will never get back
Oh look another stupid comment, original but not unexpected.
You're glad Australia was playing politics at a time like this? That's not a vote of confidence in the [NAME].
[NAME]? Yeah, that one hurts.
Have a nice day, sir. 
I wanna fight freely in a Da shitposting, but I want the bromance more.
Where is that damn SaLt LiCK
Software Engineering; had a knack for it at a young age and pretty much always knew that's what I was going to do. Yes. Extremely.
I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
Don't you feel embarrassed at all that your country answers to a country literally opposite of the world from yours?
Me too. Book of Abraham is such a headache for the church. They would love to get rid of it I am sure.
I think it was Volantis, but yeah I agree.
Its hard to look at. Its just gross.
I see what you saw there.
I’m not sure how to feel after reading this... I will say that [NAME] and [NAME] would be an attractive couple.
Hope you feel better and you’re on the way a speedy recovery.
Arguably they do, otherwise they wouldn't be out protesting for support?
And shockz isn’t? And he wouldn’t be too much of a threat for... fuck I forgot who’s on rec honestly
"Must be sad that you waste your time idolizing ""Pros"" and being a absolute poser in front of your freinds "
i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.
the idea is bad dude. that's the problem.
All I ask is to not embarrass us on National TV like they did against Philly.
I’m an anarchist, I don’t know how to read
I wish I had been born there :(
You get a lot more freedom and free time. College is a blast
No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens
Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter
I'd love to hear the theme in the style of [NAME] or the Rolling Stones
Ayyy you're welcome! x)
TIL that TYL that this is both of their jokes. Even if it was like that is funny.
Eh, Level 7 is pretty serious. Give me my Massif and I'll survive anything.
[NAME] was such a nasty POS. In his dirty wifebeaters with his malt liquor. “Men have needs...” He disgusts me.
Okay then. It sounds like you have it all figured out. Good luck.
Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery 
[NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea
Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
We're playing great!
The type of gun he's holding. My bad, my joke wasn't as obvious as I thought.
Yes please. Take the cheeto too, fuck it.
Yeah the lack of visibility of the survey likely means the survey is gonna be skewed towards people who are extremely online on this sub specifically.
YEAAAAHH!!!!YEAAAAHHH!!!!...oh, here ya go, doom-di-doom...
Oh, I thought it was about the audio glitch at the end, lol Now I see 
Tropical Oasis Liquid Multivitamin. Amazing stuff.
It's kinda sad knowing that ibises are only scavenging our bins & rubbish due to their natural habitats drying out.
I love [NAME].
This version of mass destruction is by far my favorite
ah, thanks!
That’s literally the stupidest thing ever If you think that what is stopping it to be applied to more than just bi-sexuality Seems a bit self destructive
Thanks! I've just been so irritable. I am proud of myself and my husband too.
Sweet, congrats!
Fuck with these giveaways.
This is the most beautiful story I've ever heard.
Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.
Kinda both. The show itself is mediocre and has pretty generic jokes in my opinion. But the fans make me dislike it even more.
I like to be scared actually!
Happy birthday!
Following ya for updates. I hope they catch them soon!
I love your writing style!
This literally broke my heart
Stars don’t get chicks my dude. Good way to let everyone know you are a fucking goober
We dont want or deserve to win this game. Sloppy sloppy sloppy
"[NAME] I hate bad mondays at work! He needs to fiind a new job, this one is full of ”bad clients""..."
The game felt like an awesome sci-fi TV series, with each mission feeling like a great episode. The pacing of this game was damn near perfect.
That's a great start! Amazing. I congratulate you on your self awareness. Some hugs if you want them
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.
"Thank you for the tip. I've added it to my ""to read"" list."
O don’t know man, I think they’re doing this for him, that looks great
Winning is fun
I'm sorry to hear that things went down like that. Good luck with everything.
Two or three anti depressants before I told them a lie about how I tried my moms valium and it worked
Thanks for not declaring that in a karma whory way like so many of your fellow fans
Awesome! Thanks for your reply
Haha I'd like it if our parallel lines intersect *heavy breathing*
This!!!! Just. THISSSS.
Appreciate you homie
"""You're right. Things are boring. You should find someone who isn't boring. I will too."""
Have you told him you aren't 100% ok with it? It sounds like you're regretting this decision.
Shit, I guess I accidentally bought a Pay-Per-View boxing match
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
Oh he'd be far too attractive lol He's southern anyway, would still need to put on an accent 
I reccomend the lego movie!
The rams seem pretty happy with [NAME].
Watch again. It's frosted white in the beginning and black (no window) after
I can definitely see this one
Bad timing for [NAME] to say this just now.
Just give him his damned complete control of government and media. Just give him his damned concentration camps. give him his damned Final Solution.
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly
Two horrible cunts
Ok that was a rude way to send him off. Can I have hot doctors again
My 3 year old is an asshole. His 8 year old sister was also an asshole at 3. It gets better!
this made my day/night. thank you
"I love his reaction. ""That was amazing"""
I’d tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting.
Get the fuck out
Exactly, I've seen some of her friends and family SM and is not exactly wowing me. 
Bomb on your chest Do not try this at home
Shameless karma whoring.
Never let a fact get in the way of a bad argument apparently.
Thank you that’s very insightful.
What's wrong with that? [NAME] scandal is funny but not something to focus on in 2020.
Fuck daesh *
Glad your SO was helpful and hopefully you are better
I stan ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
My [NAME] is pretty cool too
Sorry I now see how that was unclear, I mean being a unicorn on the internet by admitting you may have been wrong 
Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.
I stuck a bit of glass up there. It was a pane in the ass.
For be just being a handsome guy works wonders.
Starting?? BF4 is a lot of fun when you havent played in a while. Just faster and more immersive.
[NAME] help us, if that's what she's saying about Catholicism 101 stuff, I shudder to think what other terrible information she's putting out
I would be like pay me than or I won’t do anything for you again!
They're demonized because they're annoying.
Wow, you are quite the romantic...
Jokes are even more terrible lately
That's how mafia works
That woman on the left with red shirt and blue jeans looks really calm
I had to look those up.lol. That's awesome. Do you make money by doing so or just pure hobby?
Man [NAME] played really fucking well I hope this game especially after [NAME] last game establishes him as the starter.
Wow, thanks whoever did the silver❣ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! 
Unfortunately, on that we can agree.
100%. Do NOT order from there. I have the same story. Don’t post that place on reddit anymore. They’re a scam
I am getting a lot of weird replies...
that this ridiculous comparison is this detailed and explicit makes me think the whole beating-a-little-girl-thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies.
I love [NAME] but its been 1 year
Get [NAME] back on the wing. Looks awful in this position
That's kind of sad to be honest.
Yeah, my partner is a starfish. Thanks, i needed that precise clarification. Dead whale sex too. 
Damn you and your facts.
"Funny you should mention that since your entire presumption rests on other people interpreting ""well regulated militia"" in the same incorrect manner you do."
happy cake day
bless. wish you more beautiful days ahead!
This is a pathetic grasp to hope where there is none, hoping for a top 15 pick isnt going to bring us out of the bottom Look at edmonton
I love having twins. They'll keep each other company in their room until about 7:30-8:00 every day. So nice.
You really need to learn to read. 32 isn't too late!
You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
You’re a melon my dude, that is not how it works at all, you have been brainwashed.
thank you so much please subscribe
I wish I could’ve had that kind of relationship with my mother.
Oh wow! That's literally a game changer for me! I'm about to hit 3 digit hours and I never thought of that. Thanks!
lol robot car
Just be GOOD at what you do, and fade the chase 
Absolutely is, sorry. I just came by to say Howdy back until I saw all the hubbah. [NAME]. 
I made my own sauce for chicken dishes this week, I am happy, LGD
I love Crimson Skies.... That's a completely fucked thing to do.
I just want to die. I don't want to keep trying.
Um yea. You’re being creepy. Stop stalking her
Sorry I am kind of new to posting here. Didn't even know that existed! Gonna try and move over there.
Thank you. I will look into the protein possibility.
Yeah let's wrap up AS4 I'm suddenly so much more excited for S11
Life is just an endless series of disappointments and no one gets out of here alive.
No, she tried and failed lmao
I'm underweight anyways, somebody hand me an English to (whatever language) translation book.
As if they're going to go through that much effort... they wont even walk up the stairs to get to the box
Sometimes I wonder if people are that stupid or that malicious
"The loving mother referred to her son as ""the one with acne"". He's better off."
I can't post on r/dankmemes :(
Hate Hate Hate, feels so good.
i don't love love love it
I will not being awkward if I am being myself but I just scared
[NAME] gets punched in the head and gets a penalty.
It could be worse. We could get [NAME] or that Philly traitor [NAME] back.
You might want to look into therapy
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
ah Yuk!
Ah, see that makes ALOT more sense to me, and how I believed prayer works. Thanks for that
Appreciate you!
This. Literally this post. This post is a good start. :)
Oy! NOW THAT'S REALLY PISSED IT OFF!!
Stumbling out of a closet in full [NAME] outfit... I'm afraid it's not
The next step in human evolution is for humanity to end. Life isn't worth preserving.
That is a good idea. It may be hard for him to make any progress with him coming over so often. Thank you for you input!
It may have been funny in 2010, but now it's completely unorginal and boring. 
And then expanded on! It's so good. Haha I still remember hours and hours spent on Friends of Mineral Town though...
No lol. It’s a personal preference.
This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad.
You are a delight upon this earth
"""So... I'm gonna go back to my class and sit in my seat like you told me to, if you don't mind..."""
It's hard to try to evaluate yourself, but I appreciate you trying.
He's played the best ball of his life the past few weeks. Didn't see this coming though
You're welcome! I wish her the best.
Bro, put water in the microwave and see what happens, we're like 70% that shit
maybe next time you should do some fucking research. prohormones will shut down your test production
I laughed way harder then i shouldve
Thank you! I will!
[NAME] was selfish as hell. Stop with the revisionist history bs
You commie bastard
Looks like you clipped my own games. It’s bad lately.
Pretty sure the plate is completely visible in the article...
Hooray!! Number 1! Number 1! Number 1! Number 1!
You have a long and amazing life ahead of you...you're beautiful 💜
Dude. Same. That would just be... Devastating.
Yeah, that teacher was a disaster. She got fired a year later for just being an all around idiot.
Oooo she has a crush on you that’s embarrassing!
I CAN DOWNLOAD ADS BUT NOT THE THING ITSELF FFS
I get it. I hate that [NAME]. Taking advantage of sad people.
It's not like it's a bad thing...
Beautiful picture!
My bad , thought it was the English one 
What the fuck is that horrifying picture
My life has been destroyed
That's gorgeous!
Ugh Morons stop breeding
so painful to watch
Of course! It's all good buddy! Pretty cool if that's really you!
Fuck you're cool
You're just upset because it accurately highlights the absurdity of the minimum wage.
That lil cat, I want it!
Cool, thanks!
You literally changed someone's life for the better. You made the world a better place. Thank you for helping change the stigma against autism.
I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.
Uh well one has a long face but I think we’re thinking of different people here haha. They’re a popular 80’s band
this kid is really good
Sorry man I don’t really like duck.
I love [NAME]
Shabbat Shalom! Thank you for sharing, I really like your videos, keep up the good work!
I’m a left-leaning libertarian, and it annoys me that the left won’t have an honest conversation on immigration and border security.
We have a realistic chance of winning this.
As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass.
There’s a fairly strong intersection between white supremacists and antivacs from what I’ve noticed
I watched the whole thing. I miss that style of cartoon. Simultaneously silly and understated.
Well it very well could be your drug usage. You could be depressed also. So stop doing drugs and see a therapist.
They're taking one for the team, those brave creatures!
Show me where jokes about (real) murdered children was acceptable in the past.
Damn, even here in CA the gun haters almost invariably exempt law enforcement from their crusade.
I can do the very first part, where he first jumps.
I really hope not. I want a more feel good intermission, I’m done with being yelled at by angry old conservatives. 
Why on earth couldn't she just bring a hat from home if it was such a big issue to her? Lol.
That’s really cool of you to do man!
I remember seeing the trailer for this. I was lit when I heard [NAME]. Great movie
To be honest, I have complete sympathy for this woman and she needs help, not prison. 
Jfc, that's depressing.
Why irritated? I’m sure you said lots of nice stuff about [NAME] at the time.
This guy sports entertains.
I am glad, and enjoy. It has some pretty cool theological discussions.
The monster!
sadly it is ;-;
Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
Good, don't want speeders in my neighborhood and keeps taxes lower.
I agree. The timing is really funny to me
Papaoutai still leaves me bald.
Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems.
Been scoring big on the Groudons.. caught 4 so far. Edit: no, no shinys yet. I've had the worst luck with shinys in this game
Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we’re terrible at matinee games
Surf Wax America, great song
I wouldn’t recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.
Not really. All pretty random injuries.
12 is ambitious!! I’ll do this with you, but my goal would be 4 
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(
That poor janitor.
I miss them being alive
I like how bro is just underlined for no reason
Like I said, stunning. But not at all surprising you would reference [NAME]. 
If you have a bad memory, you have to train yourself to take notes
“and THAT’S how you kiss!”
"It's ""snowflake"" to get upset over something like this 😂😂😂"
Super Bowls are overrated anyways. s. I'm more angry about back-to-back seasons ending on a fade to Crabtree in the endzone.
Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it
He's a cool guy, he just had a rare lapse in to verysmart territory 
For me, I tend to (over)share with friends, but also get offended at trivial questions like you.
She just needs to kiss [NAME]
"This used to be the biggest circle jerk for dayz ""guys its alpha!"" Oh' how the mighty have fallen."
2. I hate to say it but it’s the same thing I do and I hate myself for it
That's absurd, people commit crimes blacked out on drugs/alcohol all the time. Also, they could just claim they don't remember it either way. 
Royals can be prosecuted. Princess [NAME] was charged under the dangerous dogs act many years back the monarch enjoys sovereign immunity.
That's slick, would love to see you guys do it.
I'm not attacking you. Which part of our conversation gives the impression that I'm attacking you? Honest question.
Thank you!
Ah good ole no child left behind
[NAME], feel bad for that streamer, everyone has their moments on this game, it’s understandable
Freakin cheers man, that looks delicious right now!
Ah got it. Sounds like most CW shows (Smallville)..thanks for the heads up :)
It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop being greedy!
[NAME] are as anti-men as democrats. Forcing your kids to be masculine because they're boys is as bad as brainwashing them with feminist crap.
Nice! I missed the Babybel.
Let me calm you down a bit:
Best of luck in your career :)
If you have to ask you're too uncool to be allowed in.
Honestly i have no clue. Just got my feelings hurt by the mean things he was saying to nurk and wanted to cyberbully him in response
Purposefully hurt people. [NAME]. I don’t understand why anyone cares.
I've recently figured out I'm the perfect mix of smart ass and sweet, the ladies love it.
I know they're probobly not good but I love charged hadoken into vskill combos/mixups. It makes her fireball more interesting than just a zoning tool.
Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you were there too. You made his day suck a little less. 
I love being a mom. My little is almost 4 weeks old and I feel like I was made for this.
Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. 
I didn't like the family ending but I liked the Atlantis ending especially as we know we are going to see more of it in DLC2.
Nah, life is too short to drive boring car colors. 
>i don't feel so good (mister [NAME]). r/unexpectedspiderman
I kind of want this win for [NAME] but I still hope we lose out hereafter
Please [NAME] that’s how I want to go!
Yeah, I don't think [NAME] supporters should use intelligence as a reason to talk down to people. I have watched [NAME] speak. Yikes.
With 8 million we could buy eight 1 million Brazilian/Argentinian players and hope 1 or 2 of them are good.
I'm at job that is effecting my mental health, and I'm not sure if I should be up front.
Yeah pretty much. People do change, but never ever do they change because someone else demands it from them.
This made me chuckle
No, it's hard to come by!

Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
If I’m ever like that, suffocate me with a pillow.
Losing to cruz azul smh
Weather forecast for Minnesota area. Wednesday -15 to -33. Sunday 43 to 29 and rain. What the fuck?
He's so handsome
I hate when MoonWolf1-799 is taken.
Yeah i miss lectures for this exact reason. Its pretty bad, but what can ya do :/
I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me
RIP [NAME], you were a sweet girl. It's been over 10 years but I still miss you.
Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there 😂 hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!
Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
Wow, that's incredible. I love the 4 quadrants idea! But the name of the business is so misleading...
Damn it, why can’t I give this multiple upvotes?! Sending love for this from the US.
[NAME] absolutely embarassed Milksmith in the game we've lost against the Griz. It never would've happened if we had AD.
Well someone should stop them!
Well...I really am [NAME], one of the original neckbeards, so maybe?
It sucks that you had to go through that. I hope you're doing fine now (and your kids if any).
Thanks for the hot take, /u/cumosaurusgaysex
He is a brave man to even have the courage to put this foundation on his face. I wouldn't have even if [NAME] told me to!
Hopefully you don't come across too many crews like that yourself though. Always better when the combat is honorable.
literally everyone until there is not a single potential enemy left on this earth that's how fascism works, buddy.
a PG that shoots 41% on free throws? pass. would much rather have jrue if we're shitposting
I'd put the Thielen TD against Packers as number 1. That was such an amazing play by [NAME] and [NAME].
Look at all the trash at that festival. Fucking gross.
.... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
that's not split pushing. split pushing is literally pushing 2 lanes at once.
Sorry but I didn’t throw in the towel for my co worker. These feelings were present before she entered my life.
I’m from Ocean County and I don’t enjoy admitting you’re right.
interesting, I'd like to see more about this (when available of course)
Waiting must be really boring
I like how they roll
OP literally said guys like [NAME] are not unicorns and not hard to find. They never said [NAME] was the ultimate standard lol
No no forms or anything. I was pleading with them not to go and it seemed surreal that I was being forced to go
The sheer size of [NAME] now is insane, would love to see him come back at heavyweight 
Where'd you go tough guy? You were talking so big before. Way to downvote and move on punk.
Interesting... is it a felony in certain jurisdictions?
It's not unheard of but there are certainly candidates ([NAME]?) who aren't quite to her level on guns.
That's a huge shame and says more about Sacks than it does anything else.
Thank you ! I thought it was funny guess no one else noticed it or thought it was funny:/
is this sub scared to talk about [NAME] getting arrested
As guaranteed me under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
>![NAME]. Apologies to the Hiyoko Best Girl gang but I could never get myself to like her...!<
huh. if there’s no pain, you’re fine. maybe just use spray on like axe or something to detour the smell 
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
Reason number 1523648856 PFF is trash no one should take seriously
Thanks for posting this.
Neither are foreign coups set up with the countries chamber of commerce and the head of the army.
So I have a hobby, I'm passionate about my 2nd Amendment rights, and I dont post/comment on reddit often. Your point?
I agree, thanks for the help and sorry for the late response.
You're welcome!
lmao I didn't realize that error.
The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by [NAME] in this game is terrifying.
Florida. I moved up here and chose the best hockey team in NY/the universe
It was weird indeed, but I liked it too! (Maybe because I’m a musicals geek).
Yeah I just googled that, I still wouldn't call them my favourite restaurant but its cheap!
I love the way they make my skin feels after I use them. I also use the primer for my makeup.
Poor and lonely.
Meth is a hell of a drug.
I’ve seen 62 to 8 in 12 hours up north. Weather is crazy stuff.
Well this is frustrating.
Honestly Quadriga has been pretty decent, can't fault them for the bank struggle, that's just how the Canadian banks have been towards this space. 
Thank you! I had no idea this existed
I hate [NAME] and [NAME] for what they've done to this franchise. And I'm growing to hate [NAME] as well.
The Grappler was fun to use, but way too strong.
Lol, I don't know the game that well
looks like got damn shoe leather.
[NAME] isn't likely to get traded. Out of the 4 he's the least likely.
Are all the people in that thread praising SB2...SB2? They all talk in a similar manner. It's odd.
I'm so happy this whole group of lines was poster. It made my day...
Your opinion doesn’t matter enough to me to trigger me :)
No fuck that guy. I'm actually relived he was shot. Sounds like a sack of human garbage
Pretty much lol
The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
Holy fuck dude. Use the mute button. Your feelings were hurt with one message, now click it, thanks ^_^
Men, you're ought to love the first hour in hospital of a new father. They're a merge of emotions that flow over the ER.
I don't need any [NAME]. But if At the Gates actually I made a game, I'd be interested.
1 Corinthians 13 😅 I am lazy so i won't write it down sry
Quit talking about politics.
Fun fact: 3 is both my favorite number and my lucky number!
The best role you can take to climb is shot caller. Give your team the information they're not aware of and they'll be more useful.
I apologize for my error. I'm not currently up to date on my regional flip flop styles.
This is very uplifting! Had very similar experiences with my wife's family. Thank you for sharing!
U can still pour it out the lock holes. Hook it up
"Thank you. I've been correcting the record for triggered authoritarians for a minute! ""Mah taxes"""
Start acting mature. Don't get into fights with security guards about how you look.
😂😂 she really is. I can’t stop laughing. She’s a fruit loop!
Unless you have actual ADHD lol. But I think this was mostly meant to be funny
Happy cake day to you too!
It's a last resort when I forget my iPod, I swear
Wow... Mid 2000's this would of been a way better follow up to Space Jam and probably just as if not more popular.
He looks especially cute in the glasses.
It wasn't a good idea then... it's been 10 years, why do you still think this was funny?
Taking a float plane is such a amazing experience - highly recommend!
I've actually been teaching myself R lately for this exact purpose, I'm super excited to check out your book when you're done with it. 
Awesome! Hope you had a good holiday
persistence that is working perfectly fine...thanks to backup scripts lol
Whhhattttt. That’s crazy!!!
Crazy how [NAME] put out his first album at the tender age of 1
Haha I had to use an analogy that rang with the older generation as well as the connection it has to social media.
Lol they were trying so hard to get that viral
This is what we have for emergencies. It’s great and takes the 1 lbs canisters that are super cheap and easy to find.
It wasn’t significant.
Who brings a gun to a middle school in the first place? This kid was not right.
Guess [NAME] back hurts more than [NAME] neck, a comeback insues.
watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)
Sorry, didn't realise I had to mollycoddle your feefees. 
Bah gawd, she is broken in half!
Oh, THAT. Yes I agree actually, I found that part rather malicious.
That's the spirit 🤣 for me it's more about strangers wanting to hug me. But you do you 😎
I'd give you a shovel so you could dig your head out of the sand, but I have a feeling you'd refuse.
Oh look what you did! Now I have to go and get my cold cream gun.
I just want to be alone in a cabin up north near flagstaff.
It’s embarrassing to share a license with them, that’s for sure.
[NAME] I hate this
Sent. And I'll check with the mods. Thanks.
Damn I was about to go out tonight.
I regret looking at his posts.
Firstly, thanks for pointing it out, and secondly, you should have some sort of [NAME] nearby, he should do the job
What a shit twat
In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy.
I got through it when I got home, thanks! :)
Oh well... I'll like both of you.
I agree. Your last sentence is definitely a better way to word it
If its affecting your mental health, you know what to do. You have a commitment to yourself first and foremost.
Hiya! 😃
"It makes for awkward conversation when I ask ""What's your favorite song?"" And I get ""I just liked the shirt"" in response"
I love this meme
yeah, there's even more registered online. scary.
Seriously? That’s so frustrating. It was [NAME] time to go, some of these “fans” are disgusting.
Bedside report is terrible.
I'm in the opposite boat. Just make the nausea stop pls thx.
I'm disappointed that this isn't real...
we legally can't do that now mr. [NAME]
You don’t need Radom sex, you will find a man who will give you what you need. Love,respect,and well.. you know..
"*Bride walks by* B: ""You ruined my wedding [NAME], great to see you!"""
What I find disgusting is thinking you can be a liberal and a ecologist. Anyone has its own ideas I guess.
It’s only missing a line that says “who was born in June” for absolutely no reason
I am worried about [NAME]. I really hope that his elbow is alright.
You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!
How dare they ask me to be a good person! I'll show em!
Trust me, I my self wish it happened before this filming
A man of fine taste!
Intentionally frightening the Queen is an indictable offence. (Max 14 years) Criminal Code
"This is nonsense. How is some random noise ""proof"" of anything? How is this relevant to this subreddit?"
I’m a little scared of telling my parents (I’m in high school.) How do I approach them about this?
also a harsh NOOOO when disgusted
Can a lad please send me one of whatever the fuck this is plz.
I like the energy [NAME], [NAME], DFS put out.
It serves as quite a lesson to anyone, don't you think?
Damn i am sad that got deleted
He will rest easy knowing how happy he made all of us
Oh thats weird. It opens the google maps app installed on my phone so i dont have that problem.
He’s soft. No heart.
Great nb rimiru
I’m upvoting for the misuse of the meme because so many people get their panties in a bunch over it.
And it tastes great because it was chilling in my refrigerator
I have a 4k screen lol. I didn't know you could do custom css rules. Thanks for the help.
My kind of man
IVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO CAMPAIGN FOR A CANDIDATE!! I stg im so happy shes my congresswoman! finally dumped comstock!!!!
while it's debatable how big government should be, I'm glad someone isn't advocating for private fire departments again. that was such a disaster
Why is she the absolute worst
Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
I just hope [NAME] isn't pulling the wagon. Would hate for her to throw up.
No actually my therapist is amazing! I've just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I meant I'm worried the doctor will say that.
There is... use a credit or debit card.... lol it hits instantly I just did it literally last Sunday
Yeah you're right. That's the problem. Not guys thinking it's ok to message someone they haven't matched with outside of Tinder.
Closing in on $300,000 now, this stream is incredible.
No, but she's lived in Chicago longer than I. 
Damn look at [NAME] and his insane get off. We could use an [NAME] now probably now than anyone on this roster.
I haven't seen it but it's on my list!!
Very very accurate.
This is the kind of relationship i want to have,a warm soothing one.... 
Farewell wonderful traffic. It's been good 2 weeks.
They're so scared
You're not. OP just couldn't follow some of the simplest rules on reddit.
Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
Well said, being alone is a stronger feeling than love! 
That’s amazing. I hope you feel this way for many many days.
Nobody is shaming them for trying to stop article 13. Youtube is being shamed for being hypocrites.
I like it. But I'm not the most fashionable fella out here.
ah, ok! i'm afraid i do, i just didn't realise that's what it meant (so old i am going stupid....)
missed a good chance to copy the one the UNC football player wrote a few years ago for an A-
Yeah, I mean we’re all just in their wake over here. I’m humbled.
Having long good chats with brother about stuff, got clear boundaries set, thanks all
Damn never heard of that, I stand corrected!
4th generation representing!
Day 7 is tough... Not as tough as day 15 but tough
That is so beautiful. It makes my heart hurt that humans can be cruel to animals when they're aware of having so much emotion.
) /sorry, the Excel formula part of my brain was driving me insane.
Yeah, right. [NAME] can marry [NAME] for that matter, as it seems only his genius is keeping her on the throne.
Thanks for your opinion. It's highly respected lol
It bothers me that he doesn’t respond to your texts. That’s weird
for a moment i got scared and wondered what was this doing here then i read the happy ending
If the goal of this show is to consistently find people with horribly annoying voices, I have to say the producers are spot on. 
This...is just beautiful
The emoji at the end just made me want to slap her
This is beautifully written.
I noticed that too. How cute.
Your comment is kinda wasted. He can't read.
thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?
One day I was really desperate and tried putting warming balms that are intended for sore muscles on my lower tummy and it helps so much!
That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].
"""Seeeee! We have one of them coloureds too!"""
I'm convinced alcoholism is rife in Ireland because ourselves and friends are all shite craic sober. Apparently the Heineken fake beers are nice.
Better than selling our souls for a fucking trophy
Beautiful shot!
I'd love for someone to pay a little attention to me
And you're a lame, sorry not sorry 
As per, they’re being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame.
Tournament was a blast met some really cool people loved it all. Thanks for holding it. Would love to do it again someday
I don't like it, simply because men never want to be just friends, and I have no interest in dating random dudes who message me.
> But my god, that fucking face. Never mind her, what about him further down.
This is going to be a disaster
Hey [NAME], just wanted to say thanks for coming to Minnesota, that’s all :) 
Ew yes I’m glad you brought that up.
Bestest boi.
They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse.
Mine were huge. I wasn't comfortable until I had them reduced. Now they're awesome.
If this is actually real it is really fucking stupid.. 400mg of nicotine!? Clearly you're looking for something stronger, might as well try heroin..
It seems you've never played HotS.
Ik these are great!
Basically he is trying to start something based on a lie, not good. If I were you, I wouldn't see this person again.
That survival rate is skewed. It doesn't include the people who don't seek treatment because they can't afford it
Averaging 12-14 off the bench isn’t nothing
Imagine that rattle.. all the way back to Michigan. Enough to drive you mad
I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :(
I've been there. It's one of the most diverse places on Earth.
I love that you know this tidbit!
You're not going to drastically improve in a day to where itll have any significance in a game hours from the postb
Poor poor poor bastard
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
Season x? Sorry bitch but no.
The Iowa State Cyclones are my favorite college basketball team.
[NAME] these are hideous
This artwork is amazing! Only thing that bothers me a bit, is that [NAME] is wearing something that looks like Korean traditional wear as opposed to a kimono
I kinda wish people memed him a lot more because he has so much comedy potential. I hope my words inspire to meme him more
My favourite goes back to one of the first battles ever on YouTube:
This is the kind of winning I love. Winning because [NAME] has 25 and [NAME] has 29
You’re not being used but she has no right to tell you what to do with your money.
Hate those ~~things~~ Tweets.
We were all duped? I’ve seen through her from day 1, even posted about how fake she is 
Only blurred photos, but could be something I suppose. Here's to hoping
only facts mate - so nothing you would be interested in
Ah thanks so much
This is the most accurate representation of BO4 I have seen yet👍👍👍
And in adult spaces in general. Let adults have things to themselves, damn it
Says millennials are afraid of hard work, dismisses the hard work required to get a fit body.
Looks amazing! You've reminded me that I need to organise a good hill walk or two this summer.
Uncle [NAME], you dirty old man.
The one that is a sentient being; the one that's most affected.
Good luck. Netflix restricts known VPN IP ranges. Your best bet is a buddy with Open VPN server stateside and open vpn client app on your device.
But I hate trannies and feminsts owo
Seems full of himself, but he also seems like an ok dude.
Nice job building yourself btw
"[NAME] was caught stealing his neighbors newspapers. He pockets all the money that is given to him and he does not use it effectively. [NAME] sad ""life"""

Oops! The bottle was so oily it slipped outta my hand and into the trash!
Damn you have a lot of alts. :D
Sorry, wrong comment train. Just gonna sneak right by ya there.
Obviously, as long as [NAME] commanded it then it's moral. Morality brought to you by stone age goat herders!
Here for [NAME], love this.
Yeah what do they expect? maybe they should realize if you push Gen [NAME] and under into poverty they won't be able to afford your crap.
Yes my man
Your funny, thanks
The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division 
He’s still right. Doortrash sucks
Awesome, great to see people coming together for peer to peer cash!
I wished my mom protected me from my grandma. She was a horrible person who was so mean to me and my mom.
Ah, our primary investigator picks another hole with his salt mining tools. Well done.
I've grown to love this idea the more I think about it. It'd be amazing if it came down to [NAME] and [NAME] as the final two
You're too ugly to even bully
Thank you.
Praise [NAME]. Hope his health issues have gotten better. Dude should be on a contender right now 😭
I'll message you when I have the time to play! :) Ty!
A little girl recently died because her parents refused to get her medical treatment and insisted [NAME] would heal her.
It’s misleading. Better article:
Oh man. I had to do it last year. Hopefully my leaders think more highly of me this year.
I changed team snapchats name to “Bae❤️” so i get exited every time I get thing from them.
It's fine, I just don't want to take the time out of my day to make food... or wait for food.
Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone.
I hope you'll be feeling better soon, friend
Guys help I can’t stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!
I agree with everything. Yet, society and its stupid outdated, conservative norms see it otherwise.
That was my wish in writing this. We all need hope sometimes. Some enchanted evening comes for each of us in its own time I think.
But also: fuck the daily mail
I love the jab berto. It’s literally in thin air.
[NAME] alright dude
This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything
Yep, still fun to theorise though!
Yeah i didn’t say i had the answers. I’m just hoping for the best
[NAME] [NAME] speed option was so much fun. They are the most criminally underrated cfb duo in my opinion
I swear no ranked team can go without losing to an unranked team for very long.... that’s why I love college basketball
Yo this [NAME] was literally pulling moves out of the Hitman games jumping over to your balcony. Thats terrifying.
Wow that's just like when I sing it
Yeah it’s weird bc in my family the basket case was my dad.
I’m so sorry :/ always happens to the ones who deserve it the least. feel better♥️
Hey, I’ve learnt something here today, so thanks! 
They’ve performed it live together so maybe you’ve heard that.
I, too, am a lot of fun at parties. We can stand together in the corner! 
I like this story way better than parvo.
This comment has sent me on a several hour journey down the rabbit hole of [NAME]. Thank you
Did this a lot when I was a kid but never did it as bad as this
What the actual fuck?
"""So, I was grading your work and someone spilled coffee on them. Sorry for the mess."""
happened to me last week too with mango, the pods were half empty and wet. handling them made my finger tips hurt after a while
I've tried this and I chipped my tooth on the tiny fork cause I'm used to plastic lol!!! I'm a mess
I’m sorry Mr. [NAME]
In fact the South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.
What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
I hate u i love u.. best song that describes that
Even that game winning kick was close. Our kickers are cursed.
This wouldn’t feel so bad if sales and footfall weren’t but many external pressures were keeping profits down.
This is so wholesome! I can‘t wait for Animal Crossing Switch! 😍🤩
If it gets caught.. it can't.. breed😱
This can’t be the end of the back, garbage TV! I’ll miss you!
I'm sure the two young sons of [NAME] are comforted by the fact that the cops involved didn't want to kill an unarmed man.
Use a damn rubber
happy early birthday OP! have fun !
Haha hopefully, that'd be good for his morale. I just wanna beat the Knicks tonight honestly. 
The part about the size of the shit was unnessecary but appreciated.
Things did not go well on Eros Station...
Crazy he took 1 year contract instead of a stable 4 year contract. Kind of shows you how dumb the guy is, 1 injury is all it takes
It was totally worth it.
It's only 5 mins, but I hope this is the one. Sorry that happened to you friend.
I've heard of Ne Obliviscaris and the Ocean. I'll check these out, thanks!
Those pearls are the worst, ugh.
Capitalism ha shifted like a huge population of the earth out of poverty, so things are globally getting better
And a pretty bad [NAME] too.
Man I wish they wouldn’t
Idk I sort of loved seeing rich kids get stranded on an island with nothing but retired 737s to get them home.
You couldn't even figure those out? Wow. Speechless.
I don't disagree with anything there.
You're mistaking a poor character for MC.
But funny, and that absolves the sin!
This is the noise I make in my girlfriend’s ear while y’all are still scared to moan
My bitch dun left me All alone She took mah squeeky ball And mah rasty bone
[NAME] we support you! Love from Mexico I hope everything works out for you, whatever you decide to do!
Leave me alone :(
Thanks mrs—mr [NAME]
Never heard of him before, But I believe in [NAME]. He’s going to be a legend after we hire [NAME]. Long live [NAME].
Thank you, I’ll send them to her the next time we talk
The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
I honestly couldn’t care what you think of me random person on the internet.
I’d love the current battle system blended with the old system of sneak/blending and a modern day story that Ubisoft actually care about.
That's why imo [NAME] death is better.
I don't know how that works, but it's definitive that it will happen on that date.
Yes, I had to drive about 2 miles to the restaurant but I only waited 5 minutes. 
Maybe delve into existentialism, read books from existentialist authors? Not that I'm a big fan of it, but maybe that could help you out.
"My favorite so far is ""national emergency declares national emergency."""
Yeeesss...... let the anger flow through you...
I have tried and succeeded. You’ve just had bad luck my friend.
Hahahah this is one of the dumbest thing i ever heard. Thank you for sharing and giving me a good laugh
You are an asshole.
Fair enough. I miss working meat
I didn’t say you should take my word for it. You’re not discussing this sincerely.
I'm fully erect tho and I still don't like them
oml I’m so sorry OP for all that
Oh how lovely and vague. Your non-committal form of conversation is delicious.
I’m sorry I only have orange ones :(
It’s spam
I literally screamed uncontrollably for 3 months and ended up in a mental hospital.
And when it's time to get him into violent videogames, just get him Viscera Cleanup Detail
Wow, that’s a big 3 year old!
Y'all are fucking annoying
Well said. And I love your username. 👑
Thanks a lot [NAME] /s
As I understand if our Libel laws had been as shitty as the ones in the UK he could.
Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
Crazy stuff! Gets 80% to shatter before taking any damage. That positioning is on point!
She looks really pretty
Now that's what I call projection!
Could not agree more!!
That took me a moment. I am ashamed and will now go commit Sudoku.
It is heated overnight at much cheaper rates. They are very well insulated.
Had surgery at 3mnths old to fill a pinhole in my back (spinabifida) Cutting myself after some severe postpartum depression
Old dirty Bastard?
To be fair, we’re still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. 
He told you to handle it, you did. If he doesn't like it, he should've taken care of it.
Something like that lol
Guilty :( I was ready to cry and everything >:(
Your response is truly one of the most amazing ones I’ve seen.
Just the name of it gives me anxiety
A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
A Mass Effect tarot deck would be awesome! That was exactly what I thought when I saw this.
Thank you I very much appreciate it.
Wow. Yes
It taunts you
Access should be hindered it's getting destroyed.
"The amount of actual debating about who is ""best girl"" is fucking ridiculous Jeez, y'all need to chill"
Man, she must really hate infertile women. 
I would trade any and all players, no one except maybe [NAME] at this point 
100%. She's made herself vulnerable to being sued by a few people.
Oh I remember that final , I just dont want to involve my team in the conversation because we share a rivalry
"""Keep blowin'! Love always, [NAME]."""
The similarity to cigarette companies is eerie.
I dont know how this is a joke. BUTT, I appreciate the effort.
Our federal budget is $4 trillion. Until entitlements are reformed the arguments over what things cost is irrelevant.
PAC man looks too fast
I’m scared.
Sorry, didn’t realize I was talking to a fan of the prestigious UCLA Bruins football program.
Ohhhhh, you're good.
> For the same reason it wouldn’t permit business with an expressly racist/sexist/etc. business But those practices are illegal at all levels already.
"I think you need to explore your motivations a bit more. I very much doubt you just want to know and ""That's all."""
Weird, never had a problem
Yepp, plenty of people like a nice big bush! I literally have no preference and think both are totally sexy. 
I'm not a jealous person. That's not an emotion that comes naturally to me. I wouldn't try to cultivate it or maintain it.
My seven year old usually wants to change behind closed doors and her decision is respected
Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
It's like they have no self-awareness, and they just engage in ridiculous hyperbole and expect to be taken seriously.
Thank you for the update, I’ve been stressing about the shutdown and lines. This helps.
YOU WRITE LIKE A YOUNGER MAN, WITH NOTHING HELD BACK. ADMIRABLE, YET MISTAKEN.
Fuck right off, it was illegal at the time so the law was being broken. Learn to live with your actions and their consequences you whiny socialists.
I used to hate them too, but since vikendi I’ve gotten pretty used to them 
First thought: OHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! Okay, time for me to submerge and introduce this MOTHAFUCKAS EYE BALLS to these hands
Makes sense, I don’t think I called out to them ever. Thanks. 
I don’t see anything awful on her. She’s old. That’s it.
Kinda weird to continuously shoot at Police too...
Of course you can. Wear a racist T-shirt for a day and see what happens.
You should make your own listing to showcase exactly this. Should be easy if it's as rampant as you say it is.
I'm so sad.
In the first game, definitely, but they're more even in 2/3. 
I've used tofu and nutritional yeast before. It works well for ricotta! Recipe here!
That’s so nice! Kindness like this makes my heart happy.
Uh. Okay. I dont thats likely to happen. Even when people were eating babies it was not die moral reasona
If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
Lol okay. It's not like they're billion dollar organizations that have their own personal agenda. Fine. Enjoy your bubble.
Absolutely nothing! LOL
It's not funny. Your neighbor doesn't sound very bright.
Takes a lot less effort to just say “fuck off, buy your own.”
Hahahaha. I can picture it as if I was a fly in the walll. I love mj like [NAME]
How are they assholes?
>so it doesn't seem like I'm a ~~whimp~~ wimp If someone actually says that to you, they're the wimp not you.
I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
I think you're right. I've been proactive before and it helped. Thanks and hope this year is good to you as well!
That was actually Chicago. Cute as hell though
Sweet. Thanks [NAME]
Thank you! I’ll look for his art. Btw I have no idea what Faces of Death or Traces of Death is
One of my all-time favorite bands, and one of the best live acts you'll ever see!
You obviously have never seen those creepy videos with 10m+ views with kids. And those Elsagate videos.
Play something else and come back later. You’re burning yourself out
No, go home
Oh heck oh frick
If you're talking about tfue you're insane. He plays scrims for hours, every, single day. 
That’s gotta hurt.
I’m too poor to watch this 🙈😂
Ok thank you!
Or maybe just don't have a family and you're financially secured for life.
He’s such a pervert.
All I'm seeing here is that you commited a brutal murder.
Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
I care. How are you today?
You can thank the Volkswagen diesel scandal for this...that plate was
lmao im am using ALL of this money to pay my student loans! and starting with a $100 again, see if ill do it again :)
good move. needed another lefty in the pen.
That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.
Such a sad way to think of life all because these people believe there's something greater than this.
heh, I remember that commercial.. Was pretty cringy
Ok. You’re just being silly now. Good night.
My birthday is in March, so that MK11 Beta access is also going to be awesome.
I like it!
I know what I said son
Good to see this getting traction again. It really exposes [NAME] to be a useful idiot, and his supporters to be even dumber than that.
I've been waiting to watch [NAME] die for a long long time. Sure hope that one is right.
Exactly! When the mom went to kekeing in [NAME] face to FaceTime with [NAME] in all of 10 minutes my jaw fell to the floor!
Testing it out in creative it feels like the hunting rifle got a huge buff this patch, cant wait to bring out one of my favorite weapons 
I’m so homesick and I come here for photos like this.
This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay
[NAME] and [NAME] would be amazing, maybe [NAME] too.. The Rolling Stones, [NAME] and [NAME].
Interesting how the before photos are clearly yellow-tinted, as can be seen by the difference in the skin complexion 
Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
If you all keep nagging me with this question I will turn this car around and then *no one’s* getting to watch the trailer.
Thanks for gping to the effort, but i would be surprised if he read it and gave it the chance he have trump. Pleasantly surprised, though.
Weird flex, but ok
Because [NAME] was playing awful in the first two sets. Absolutely terrible.
Yayyy!!! Go little green bean go!!! Good job trainer!!
Sigh, that was beautiful 😢
I love how much [NAME] winds up the tories and just shouts over them while they protest - great speaker
Oh wow. That sucks to hear about [NAME]. I guess not uncommon with a bad family life.
They’re more and more surprised every week when this is reposted.
Wow, your posting history is a real... interesting ride.
This is dumb. Why is Detroit Lions infiltrating here.
Ooooof, that’s annoying. I’m sorry.
Therapists hate this trick!
wow thanks for the explanation. it's been like 3 hours and still looks like this
My bad I just realized it, I’m 31M and she’s 31F
"he tried to motivate the team in the locker room but i think it was [NAME] who was like ""just sit down festus"""
I love me some RFM. My wife said he talks like a robot.
Lucky I caught people reacting on twitter. For some reason I thought this game as at 6 PM.
You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool
Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.
> ftw Awesome statistic. Made my day! Love it
Buying Bitcoin at it's peak is the equivalent of people buy Fyre festival tickets. I'm glad I did neither
[NAME] ran out of her way to butt into the conversation with [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] . I can't stand [NAME]
I am. He's the easy pick. Would be perfect for this franchise. I'm worried that he won't make it to us.
Nah I'll be right thanks [NAME]
Omfg the worst!! want to pull my hair out!!
You know this is really messed up and unacceptable, but it mainly forced the realization that I’ve never played with Omniknight.
omg, id cry if this was my store 
I have always loved [NAME], love the deadpan humor of him and peavis, and he's just a talented and amusing guy.
I didn't turn the sounds on because I'm in bed and it LOOKS nasally
Thank you for doing your service. The world is now a better place because of you
Don't use autism as an excuse to be an asshole
It's a really fun game and is a great way to hang out with friends. Hope you have fun!
01/11/19 - pretty easy to remember as it is the day my band released it's first full length record. The release day gig was also pretty neat!
good start [NAME]. MORE! MORE TRADES! GET WHAT YOU CAN! SELL, SELL, SELL! #BurnItDown #NobodyIsSafe #ShapeUpOrShipOut
Agreed, even better
This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
Nah they'll make their own post that's really passive aggressive about SOME people not understanding [insert fatlogic excuse here]
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
The chicken and bacon one sounds absolutely baller. I’ll have to check it out! Thanks
I think only time will heal this pain that I’m going through. I hope I get over him soon, especially before school starts!!!
Nah, you're nice peoples who eats pickles.
At least she didn't cough into it afterwards. Double whammy
I'm so racist and self important I refuse to braid this girls hair
Thank [NAME], good luck and hope you find the happiness you seek
OOOOOFFF, now that'd be a kick to the head
he stopped talking to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
So... no nerd here to say the stomach doesn't really do that? Is this Reddit or what?
he is a very dangerous man
"""So long, [NAME]"""
Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying.
Agreed. You can't count on him every night. The entire team is frustrating as hell
Yes, definitely classy. <rolls eyes>
Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
A lot of things men do *isn't* sexual harassment no matter how you feel about it.
It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll
We always look so hot headed at road 😞
Because you aren't serious. You're just mad because you got told to stop using slurs one too many times.
It kind of blew my mind to see that after reading some of the most generic advices in that post. Who the f* upvote these posts?
You didn't need to split this into two posts...
The NEW & IMPROVED Doggy Slinky!!! Everyone loves a Slinky!
Oh my god, who in the world eats their cracker without its Shell? Simply disgusting, didn't even had to ask. Smh
I can do that too but I have diarrhea
One of the better shutdown memes I've seen. Have an upvote.
Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.
What changed for [NAME]? Last season he had a spurt of being meta and dominant and [NAME] was a bit of a terror
You're not wrong, [NAME], you're just an asshole.
Precisely that. I hope you’re able to find strategies to deal with it easier, it’s really tough
You progressively lose more of your money!
I'm sure he immensely appreciates the gesture.
Doesn’t offend me, I just don’t like looking at it. 
I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
Perfect example of the disgusting misuse of ‘Orwellian’ on this website
I refuse to accept that
Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too
Thanks for the reply! I appreciate your input. Please keep me in the loop, I’d love to be more active with this if possible.
It was a few years ago now, I’m afraid I don’t have it or I would.
I’d love to get an update on what happened! (When you are ready)
Thank you!
Go for a walk with him. No phones allowed. Let him talk, share your experience. It hurts a little less every day.
Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume?
The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.
Pure unconsitional love can also be dangerous: if the other person turns out to be an abuser you should propably stop loving them
[NAME] you like picking and choosing. not how life works. not how fact works.
Thx! Keep waiting for her to take over and say NERF THIS
noob spam haha
That was awesome!
Sorry for all the questions I just find ASPD to be a fascinating disorder. I have BPD SO to me not having emotions sounds like a dream.
I played for a decade+ on release, I'd be happy to help you or anyone else!
Sweet thank you!
genuinely funny - downvoted
I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby
I've never read an article that made me experience both disgust and schadenfreude in equal measure like this one has.
I can't believe you would call me that and act like nothing happened. Honestly, what's wrong with you
I like how the ceremony goes right out the window after he delivers the rings to get all the pets.
Mf perioded on my new sofa
Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
Their roster just doesn’t work, sadly they didn’t realize it in time.
You two seem nice.
[NAME], are you a real person? Thanks for proving his point about how uneducated you are. 
OMG, crying laughing right now. Hubs and I both. What a visual!
This is the worst Hellraiser reboot script I've read this month, and let me tell you, I've read a lot of them.
No its not, a AGM can do damage in excess of 15m$.
Gah!!! I wish you well! Also, what NERVE they have.... wow.
"I read that as ""It's fat being fucked in the picture"" lmfaoooo"
I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
Ooh I thoughy today was last day. Damn it I spent 10 hrs playing HvV today😑.
2005? I think we might be the same person lol. What a terrible year. I go back to that one a lot.
I miss candlestick :(
Thank [NAME] for you
It's nice to see someone regognize my username :)
this is super cute, i love it
I have a headache from watching that
very interesting - I’ll have to read up on him - thanks :)
Yeah the non guarenteed packs are really the worst. I think I did 2/20 on those.
Even weirder way to spell [NAME].
Lol don't worry, they even make you somehow hate [NAME] in season 2.
Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
i appreciate the consistency of your values.
I love the vid, I just wish it was longer ;_;
I can't delete my account, so I'm just gonna edit the post itself. Thank you for your help!
I like how submissive the coyote is being to this tiny little cat. Like, dude, you could just eat him.
I hate [NAME] but this dude has already lied to Congress. How can you believe anything he says
I’m just gonna see how tomorrow goes tbh. I’ll take life one day at a time :) thank you for the help ❤️
Ha ha. You can't define something into existence.
I like to hope I can convert some of mine.
What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
They hated him, because he told them the truth
lol that was just bad, [NAME] 
Let's all go to Dragon Laaaaaand!
Please be [NAME]. I like [NAME], for the record. But I'm def willing to part ways with him. 
Glad we can take a win into Philly.
Day one of new job official duties on the books. I survived! One day down, 35 years to go... :]
Nia even in its current state vr can help you with that. And maybe even more 5 years from now.
For cart pushers, I can’t recommend getting good winter/rain gear highly enough. Good socks and waterproof/resistent shoes will make a world of difference.
Yeah right like they always talk about themselves why can’t I gets me so pissed off
Personally, I assume that those who claim NOT to be deprived in this way are just adept liars. That's how deprived I am.
Yes - summer, and I was with my parents who did all the actual work so I just got to relax with the baby! 
I was so worried for the kitty the whole story.
Yes that was abuse.
Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
Don't cope
I love lamp.
Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring.
you are definitely trolling us. That can't be true
Wish this applied to TPS's
I apologize if I came across that way, it was not my intention. I meant only to state a fact.
Just did that. He ignored me and didn't respond.
That wasn’t part of my plan
And [NAME] just got laughed off the stage. How things would be different if he had won. Seriously timelines would be so different.
Fun ruiner.
Why are you so angry?
Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
So true.... hes my baby but I never expected his level of protectiveness, hes literally an ounce so it's pretty crazy to see
This. I relate to this. So much. Almost too much.
Fuck I’m sitting in position 3 right now
But when you do, just remember that trick so you don’t have to take your break or get an RI. 
Me too. I have so much shit and I can’t imagine taking any of it into my car and piling it that high. Wtf?
I don't think they really learn so much as they relax and get more comfortable.
lol i've done the same with the pan flag, one time literally drew it on the sidewalk and explained what it was, somehow nobody got it...
Fair, yes, [NAME] is against that, so a good transition on your part.
Obviously. If we were able to make such logical risk/reward assessments it wouldn't be a problem.
“I love food! Or “I’m a foodie!”
I’m not gonna lie guys, if we help a team break their 9-game losing streak I’m gonna be pretty upset.
You used the correct term. Good job.
That first picture perfectly depicts the epitome of a punchable face.
dude stop your gonna make me cry. This is horrible please don't do this STOP right now. Dont it's just not worth it
"You know the first thing they're going to ask ""so, are you hungry?"" "
Go lie somewhere else. Go to Faux News or something. They,ll believe you.
Got boarded, ejected, and ship damaged... very poor tactic.
maybe. Id praise her for it though. In a world of... instagram beauty... its refreshing when someone is just themselves
You are a shining ray of light in a dark chessless world. thank you my friend.
> Imagine the ~~nightmare of regulation~~ flood of unregulated money these guys are up for- congrats.
well that's no creepy in the slightest
Hey, you sound like you're living my exact life. It's a good life. Enjoy sharing the love. 
"I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
This sub is very very bad at irony
Great pass by [NAME]
So its not mum and dad then.
Thank you. We’re seven months into reconciliation. We definitely had HB for the first couple weeks as well.
So you stay on your theft from auto waiting for them to dispatch the next shift to the backlog of calls.
NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
The tactical alliance between PYD and the US doesn't fit the characterization of intervention. That's also not relevant to what the hashtag is about.
Had a great time playing overwatch, but only *some* of us were getting too drunk for everyone's entertainment >.>
My stress levels are really too high. Let Tuesday bring some good news...
That was a great episode
In 5 days bones would not be crusted over,sorry not buying it.
You're so fucking original
CENTRISTS ONLY LEFTISTS GO AWAY also stop downvoting we don't want a circlejerk.
Awesome quote.
I've always hated the 610/45 interchange. Everyone slows to a crawl when there is no need to slow down.
Some judges are just literally scum. Have those in Germany aswell. Unfortunately.
Me, because I'm a narcissistic bastard.
This is powerful. I appreciated it so much. I hope to end up as free and as confident as you
"Gotta love the ""its a metaphor"" guy, who has apparently never read any other comments by [NAME]"
Im so interested in learning more about the Garrison EU.
Metallica recorded a congratulatory video for him, so effin cool: 
Sure would hate to explain sodium and water to them as they sprinkle salt on their food.
Obviously a degree in veterinary medicine, in case Mr [NAME] has the sniffles
It absolutely is. Sadly, most players seem to only want [NAME] with different aesthetics.
Thats pretty sweet.
Oh god I thought he career was long over
Shame our government can't progress as fast as the infrastructure.
This looks delicious, I wish I had all ingredients on hand, because I would make this tomorrow.
The Mets fans in me gets excited for [NAME] when I hear [NAME] theme.
Previously it wasn't working, now its fine though
Because lost media presents a question with no answer. Humans are curious creatures, so presenting them with knowledge that cannot possibly be learned is extremely frustrating.
Thank you! I was wondering what to do tomorrow morning. Now I have something to go to.
Drs hate him!
I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
Then he stabbed like five cops and hid in a haystack
Really wow, what a steal
Sex is gross and gross things are immoral to conservatives unless they are doing them.
Some rambling paragraphs about what a waste I am and how sorry I am to be a disappointment to those around me and that sort.
Lol, that’s funny. I’ll have to find our Aggieopoly and see how it compares.
That’s [NAME]. One of the most famous and richest criminal defense attorneys in the world.
It’s okay, my mom has always hated me and I’m fine.
Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, “You’re still here and you can still do amazing things.”
My knees, I had to quit running because they got so bad. Even hiking starts hurting after awhile, especially on long downhills Also glasses and deep voices
He insisted on a monogamous break and I agreed.
Apple can still go kindly fuck itself tho
PUT THEIR BLINDFOLDS BACK ON!!!
Not really, the save file has nothing to do with the engine.
“So which one is she” “Uhhhhhhh.....”
> not broken I beg to differ.
I think a budget PHD or DNP would cost me 35k so not happening.
[NAME] damn what a comeback. I love this teams fight.
How stupid are you, if you dont réalize it’s staged 
If you just slam on the brakes and accommodate these assholes they usually don't even realize they've done anything wrong
Can these be made so in the future it could be made even higher? Like adding an additional 15 feet or so? Would be cool...
[NAME] met and fell in love with her wines I see.
What a nice person helping the mentally disabled.
Throw it all on the mortgage. Don't spend it on garbage you think you need.
> Best ~~3pt~~ shooter fucking ever. FTFY
Just like in Seinfeld when the waitress called the audible after [NAME] talked about how much he likes manure.
Good grief... cushion those talons with some toilet paper or Kleenex next time. It’ll give you better traction, too. 
Here’s hoping this ends soon lol
[NAME] is so rational, I’d just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money 💰 
As a non-immunocompromised person I like their stance.
Still looks pretty delicious, makes me really want an omelette rn tbh
I had a young woman patient who was repeatedly found on the floor, naked and masturbating.
Oops. My bad
You are totally right!!! Complete waste of time
Ok for what it is fake or not this is fucking hilarious lmao
The children are still being abused, neglected and treated like rubbish. White Australian policy has been horrific and continues to be horrific.
Out of all the seasons I definitely feel the worst for her
Don't worry--reminders like this are exactly where grizzled old guys can help out most.
Today on someone flamed me in chat
Not complain. She could not complain since she made no effort in the beginning.
IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ME, I HOPE DO NOT PASS THE SAME AS WITH THE OTHER GIRL ... 😳
I was having a good day. We were ALL having a good day.
Glad you feel better! My offer still stands though, if you need someone, I’m here
Dallas didnt play our schedule lol Even with VJ we could have beaten that team lol
😂 thanks. I like yours!! Makes me think of yoga retreats but like in the best way possible
>How can I hate [NAME] I like [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]? And [NAME]
Must be fun, just rewriting history at will...
Lmao good man
Great, good to hear he was positive, so to speak, about it.
I just guffawed at work. I hope your lawyer takes him to the cleaners.
[NAME] might steal this format if that’s ok with you lol
I feel like it took for fucking ever actually. Still too fast, but anything would be
Probably scared they’re gonna get flashed by a camera.
Don't hold your breath!
It is sad they didn't have a 4k highspeed camera running on this... I feel like the world lost an amazing possibility
I just have never found that area very attractive. Also from what I understand there is a lot of contaminated burial sites around there.
Right on. Hi from saskatoon canada. Take care buddy
Yeah that doesn't sound fun at all. I may just stick to the burbs.... Thanks for the reply.
I would tend to agree, but it’s also the crypto market. You never really know what it’s going to do lol
Disgusting trash feminazis, fuck your hijab
Eh I work oilfield so my sample of peoples opinions is probably pretty skewed. Still super embarrassing knowing this many people are so ignorant.
You mean, their gender. And no, we really just do as much as cis person.
No, that means you're actually 41.
This is the most adorable thing I've been made aware of. Possibly ever. You are being super sweet.
I mean I love [NAME] as a player, but emotional attachment aside, we really need a consistent shooter 
don't you hate it when that dogs are doing drugs behind your house?
Doesn't matter if hes in this sub, hes sliding into your girl's DMs rn!
I played in the WSHL last year and this really isn’t a surprise. It’s crazy how unbalanced the competition is in that league
Lindt don’t fuck about
Favorite: Hardhomme! That epic stare down at the end! Least favorite: No One. Completely ridiculous and unbeleivable
yes it does.
just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
I second that. A broader mobilization and awareness would go a long way.
Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction.
I mean, is that really a guilty pleasure? It sounds like the coolest thing I have ever heard. 
Same can be said for fragile liberals who can't handle cultural traditions and keep trying to push the envelope.
now thats a good use for a glue gun
No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
Thanks grandpa, it’s always good to see you around the holidays. That joke is hilarious every time!
Definitely not lol You could probably find a better boogyman than that
Agreed. Personally I don’t understand meeting up for just sex, but I still don’t judge those who do it. 
I’m sorry for your loss op
> like beer, is a waste of time Sir you forget yourself!
Oh thank you for the name, is there any way to get rid of them? 
PayPal is fucking pricey. 500 bucks to Mexico cost me 60$
It hurts to snap out of that denial and face the truth your loved ones are dead... I guess.
well put yourself in his shoes though, it could make for a possible hostile working environment as well as be detrimental to his livelihood.
The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly!
My favourite series are House Party and A Way Out. The Sonic comics episode is a golden too.
Burn themall!!!!
I also love that her correction was wrong. But all the bustling millinery on The Island can do that to a person.
There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
Very happy with this !
[NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder.
Sorry bb :( I understand that feeling all too well, haha
Yeah good life to you too. Let's hope you and your commie friends dont die of starvation and poverty in your glorious communist future.
Gotta love Alabama School Fundraisers. You know that dad paid big bucks with how excited he is
Optimism and emotions got us into this mess in the first place ffs. At least clarify why you are optimistic.
If the blindness ever comes back for whatever reason, try doing this:
Shai-Hulud! Bless the maker and his water
Its whatever you make of it. No one can tell you what it feels like except you, this is a journey you’ll have to take alone
TIL iguanas can be pretty cute
Not enough that the median incomes for those without a degree to be close enough to those that did as to not be significant.
I'm just tired of feeling the same way everyday it's really grinding me down, that sucks about your summer school.
Also assumes a kid only has one teacher K-12 at school. Which is ridiculous.
It was stupidmancostume
[NAME] I hate Twitter
effective java! It's a classic.
All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere. 
Oh [NAME], me and kiwi or pineapple. Or that feeling when a tortilla chip gets stuck in the roof of your mouth
I'm happy that you got the [NAME] back, some people just don't have respect for others and think that they and their kids deserve everything
No it's because we're ugly, short, and ethnic 
Nothing better to do with their time, I guess?
Lol. That's exactly what I said. Yep. That's it.
Not all. [NAME] is cool. If he ever runs again in the primaries he will get my vote.
Wow! Dude has aged well. Maybe I need some of that snek oil!
Thanks. People on the sub are unreasonable. They think [NAME] is worth so much yet won't give up much for [NAME]
[NAME] doesn’t use reddit, but I’ll bring it up with her. She might find some good support there. Cheers! 
*ads even more trashier
Best comment ever.
Freaky, more like creepy
Hence the apology note.
Shrug. Cant blame anyone other than your parents.
Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
To be honest I miss the deep bomb on 3rd and 2. Watching the Browns game reminded me how I always love when it worked.
Lucrative. I like it.
Yes. Especially if I go to sneeze and I lose it, I just look up to a light and bam. Sneeze time!
Yeah I love my friends and my own cats on drugs. They're the perfect buddies. I love being with them when I'm tripping.
Looks pretty dope.
I would never wish for someone to get injured, but an injury needs to happen at the Pro Bowl so they cancel it forever.
Weird I'm short and have anxiety and depression and somehow I'm not an incel.
No, no. I love the ones where patients succeed. It’s not that. It just seemed like everyone phoned it in this time. 
Winter depression has finally gotten to me. So damn bored even with all these bowl games on.
Oh [NAME] how awful
I fucking hate [NAME]
The clothing comes in individual plastic bag from manufacture, but I do agree with the plastic packaging for the jewelry. That amount of plastic is unnecessary.
TSA agents are like tow truck drivers. Everyone hates them.
Happy belated cakeday.
Now that's a beautiful cake but that's way way WAAAAAAY too much icing for me... Added a good 5 inches to the cake damn!!
I hope they don't do that just to please pissed off fans who want everything to be cliché.
Yes! And also when you accidentally look at someone and think that they think that you're checking them out or something.
That is incredibly disheartening.
okay, enjoy living in ignorance and hatred
CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.
[NAME] damn I need a cigarette now
That sounds plausible. Lets hope that you are wrong for both countries' sake.
I blurred the names of the others it's about [NAME] being [NAME] 😂
Phoenix and Orlando are teams I hear sniffing around [NAME] in free agency. Both make sense.
Like an idiot.
This article was written so poorly that it's hard to take seriously. It's like a stream of consciousness with very little to actually say
Only all the time. As of a few years ago it’s been impossible for me to do it, which is discomforting to say the least.
He is so boring ....
Put that back where it came from or so help me...
We don’t like to talk about that
> I want to feel peace and not have to wake up everyday anxious for what the day has in store. I can relate to this.
The fuck is “mog?!”
Love this - beautiful penmanship
Love the view. I would love to drink rum with a view like that. Have fun!
Hell, no. Teenagers just aren't that interesting.
was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )
Seeing people overtaking on the right makes me anxious.
I'm starting to think you're just an idiot.
MTV loves Indiana
I freakin love this channel
This makes me so happy, having a step parent can be a sensitive thing but you are definitely a good example of what to do, congrats!
No one gives a fuck about your internet points guy
Oh, I felt that despondency at the end there. Poor guy. 
I do. Am chemist. Stop serving me things that remind me of work, goddamit.
Like idgaf if it’s fortnite themed I need those in my life again
i love you.
She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]
Huh. Weird.
I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.
Great job thanks!
I am. But I presume you are gonna tell me I'm wrong because it doesn't line up with your experiences - whatever.
I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. 
Still the greatest timeline tho
Just do the steps and stop complaining.
If you really think a horror movie needs jump scares then I feel bad for you son.
They both crazy
It isn't called the immortal science for no reason ey
Fuck. That.
you just use the word weird like that's all there is to it. weird isn't the issue. the issue is garbage
Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous.
Good [NAME].
No she would just get 18 years in jail (raising a kid).
But it taste and look so good 💦👌
This offseason has been so upsetting
[NAME] I hope we get lucky again. Great job with the write up. I don’t follow college ball too much so this helps a ton.
What a beautiful moment
Gotta love jetpacking.
Thanks for the honour of speaking with the representative of atheism.
Wait until you’re at least 25 to get a tattoo. You’ll more than likely regret it otherwise.
“My Girlfriend, [NAME] has returned! Greetings my love!” ~[NAME], 2012. 
Thanks for catching that. Fixed.
Lol people still watch CBS?
Canadian [NAME] here to disagree with you. Politely. Sorry.
#Screw you, [NAME].
This is amazing. Love these edits.
Great point.
I'm a university student and even though I have a job, I'm going to find out about this at school. Thanks for the tip!!
Would be a good idea what deal labour wants.
Omg yes lol
Glad [NAME] found some love in his life
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.
It's very convenient!
This post is inappropriate for this subreddit.
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?
Yeah, that lamp was pretty tall and slender. But I don't think there were any lights on upstairs.
Lmfao, so true. 
I don't wish abortions on any woman. It's a terrible thing to endure. Necessary, sure, but it's still grim.
Nah she's just a dull asari doctor, with a pleasing voice.
I’ll give it a shot. Thanks for the alert. If this sub consistently hates it, it can’t be that bad.
We're not the only one that has it, but for a city of our population, we're probably one of the worse offenders.
Yea having children will always solve the problem
I am pleased to report that my 5 win streak was broken.
BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.
It really sucks that almost everything we know and love about [NAME] is either told to us by proxy through other characters or is the result of fan-fics/shipping.
Do you not commute to work? It's still like that during rush hour traffic.
I enjoy being a girl. (are shutdown memes still allowed? ...No matter. Couldn't find a decent one for this)
"Thanks for the tip! You get bonus points for no spelling mistakes. If I can offer a tip in return, look up what ""ironic"" means."
"Doesn't matter how much experience you have, you're still delusional and most likely attracted to the ""wrong"" kinds of men"
Fuck I’m hungry now.
Just like an unwritten rule to discuss a perfect game during a perfect game. Interesting
[NAME] is a monster, my favorite of the Pythons. Such a perfect smug face.
Fair enough ;)
I was under the impression that [NAME] also has some pretty rough health problems.
yeah. thanks for your reply
I'm sorry that America funded a coup, but I get to have my Medicare. - AOC
My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
Maybe Streamlight Strion if OP wants something Fenix PD35 sized? Havent used one myself but have heard good things.
Different agencies, I guess. My agency would have the whole squad felony stopping these clowns.
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
Im glad your out too! Im glad you found joy in camping =)
This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again
I’m sorry, you just sound like one of those people who takes overwatch super seriously and has no life
Ya know, I hate lying but I guess I'd make an exception for this. 
"screw up phrasal verb of screw INFORMAL•NORTH [NAME] completely mismanage or mishandle a situation. ""I'm sorry, [NAME], I screwed up"" Is a murder mishandling a situation?"
But it looks so cute
Trust me no one getting caught but this dumb MF
M'goodboy. His mommy better give him plenty of tendies and honey mussy for his good manners.
Finally some news from [NAME]. Hope he goes with DAZN. Would love to see him face [NAME] next.
Cool as hell
Go away [NAME]....
I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.
I love the downvote followed by zero response. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, goodnight *mic drop 
Nothing more Jersey than the sound of car horns over [NAME] rambling out an annoyed answer to a caller.
We can’t stand for this any longer!
I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry.
Some people just don't understand humor. Imagine living your life like that!
Wanting to feel sexy isn’t really a thing that applies to me tbh
Nah no one can help me
I ate 2 lots of rice a day, with chilli. I also had a bowl of high carb cereal. I lost 4stone. CICO, is real! 
Wow, I wasnt expecting that to be a real sub lol that's awesome
Yo I love that game too it’s great
Curse them out.
Oh sorry, I'll do that.
I’m sorry but I don’t think you do
That was straight up reckless
To each their own. I enjoy it for what it is
Reality is often disappointing
Im always worried that League Pass won't be the Orlando Feed. Thank god today is [NAME] and [NAME]
Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night
thanks, just sold my house to go all in
Tbh I don't quite get the hype behind [NAME]
This is terrible advice
He really channeled his inner [NAME] for this goal
Lets fuckin do this
Now there is no one face to face so tough is an option
Well, ok then nevermind. I'm surrounded by people I mostly disagree with, but I honestly don't know anyone that I would call outright evil. 
Nope. Just running from people wielding axes like a normal person. Instead of acting like a tough guy on the internet like you.
That's still crazy to me as it's the same price online and in store here. We just have a flat rate.
I can feel that already, I'm already getting pain at time with it, but I can only imagine the pain after for healing.
[NAME] 31m contract is horrendous, I hated it when he signed it and I hate it now.
you give him way too much credit with this one
Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.
Guys this team is SOOO FUN THO!!!! LIKE OMG
Man fuck, I didn't come here for these feels...
Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
Don’t know how I missed that
I love foreign money. I enjoy making origami from it.
I love people like this that don't understand how taxes work...
Funding was never the problem of Mass Effect. EA is. You're confirming their bad business strategy.
Still can’t blame him.... we’ve all been there
Being a complete idiot and blocking a road in front of a bar. Which is where most cops tend to hang out trolling for DUIs at 2 am.
This gave me ultimate anxiety
Citation found, dumbass.
Happy cake day
Cool. Hope they intended to clean it up but this kind human beat them to it.
I'm glad it helps, best of luck on your journey. You've gone 7 days clean, keep doing what makes you clean for 84 more!
i was in that thread, but i can at least admit it ;)
Have an interview in 11 hours and it's after 2 AM bet LETS GOOOOO
Okay I can see this looking really cool for a festival or photos though 😄
Interesting. I’m very against the death penalty.
“I am going to be going through a nasty divorce in a few years so I will need the money.” - [NAME]
I scored 9 points... I totally love it that everybody is sweating ;D
I love all things supportive of books and spreading their wonderfulness.
That uncle was awesome.
no, educate yourself like an anarchist. 
Hope your surgery goes well and a quick recovery!
I’ll take one [NAME] please
You missed the chance to title it [NAME] :(
Thank you for sharing, that was some very big-brained marginalia. Now remember to wash your penis and clean your room before you play minecraft
For real. After I saw that, I just stopped reading. My eyes spun right out of my head. 
The parallel to the mistake you're making is so apparent I no longer believe you're discussing this in good faith.
You better go to a church tomorrow and repent..also, tell the Pastor what happened. I am serious. 
Ugh, the learning curve for hurdles has to be a painful one... kudos for finishing. Last couple falls probably destroyed her knees. 
visit your school's career center and speak to a career counselor. he/she can help you with referrals. good luck!
Ok, thanks for the clarification. I don't find it compelling but I appreciate your time and patience.
I'm disappointed in you too.
Yes I would rather have a government agency waste the money on food stamps. Right wing moron.
Your mental gymnastics are absolutely astounding
You’re right. Pressing f.
Wait, you have friends that love you? You're gonna be okay dude. I promise. 
I asked her before I told her. She took it on herself. I say NO all the time when I don't want to hear sadness and pain
dude,,, same i cried today because i couldn’t go to the gym bc my foot was too swollen to wear shoes lol
Fair. Actually fuck the last few songs on Bleach.
I pray the chains that make this life hard are broken by gods power and you are freer with each day!
According to BluePundit you should delete that if you care about upvotes, lol.
I regret this knowledge, give me back my ignorance damn it!
I feel like [NAME] isn't a legend.
Whenever I'm having a bad day, I watch a few eps of Cosmos to chill out.
Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
They’re all nothing but a pack of liers and should all be thrown in jail
Flat out getting our ass kicked. Gotta give it to Memphis, they have just shut us down
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.
Hey, 3/4 of BB20 was amazing. 
Why or when was he ever a locker room cancer though? Am I missing something? Thanks for the downvote for asking a question, though. 
LOL, once in a lifetime. Sheesh, this sub is obsessed
Do you have the car? Why didn't you get copies? What aren't you telling us?
As much as I love the dodgers, I can’t see them in the World Series 3 times in a row... so yeah, backwards.
Ha. Fair enough.
Worried about it escaping....now that's fresh food.
You’re right. Thanks so much, appreciate it. 
Very interesting link, thanks for sharing. Happy New Year!
I have no friends.
This is gold!!!!! Im impressed. Very accurate.
No-no-no-noooo Besides, [NAME] is not a bachelor. He is so in love with himself already
You're a legend.
I opened reddit to masturbate then I saw this. It's hard but... it's the right thing to do Thanks! Take it easy :)
Well I'll be darned.
I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. 
I understand why he's confused but [NAME] is the host of the show, he can't just leave
Thanks for the reply. They are saying the engine issue is in cold weather. I live in NY. Does it get cold where you live?
Hey fuck-o I've broken plenty of rules I just have the decency to be ashamed of it.
Then present an opposing argument.
3h late comment. have fun at school !
Its the same AS to go to a bank and to say My kid loves money give him all of it
We had some sparkling apple in our ICU tonight as well! Happy new year!
I saw a pic on twitter where she was also wearing a fur stole and she looked amazing.
I hate y'all too
I hope if you ever have need of help for mental illness that the person who responds is not like you.
Your idea of the supposed limitations of bots is actually hilarious.
$42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. 
"Its supposed to be an ""eye opener"" to those claiming the winning team was lucky. I am not saying either is correct."
Fucking coward.
Lol, you guys are as popular in this thread as in real life!
Well. Good... they should know they've pissed me off
This is disgusting.
Kids disturb more and are MORE ANNOYING.
It's a waste of water to shower that often.
Oh nice, VB using him as their own populist tool to grab the attention of the overtly racist and scared of brown people.
 goat handshake denied Personally, I just think [NAME] was scared of touching such a relic as is [NAME] hand
Please get your soy away from me, i’m allergic.
Sorry mate, you’ve got the wrong sub. This is for **bad** UK.
Can't stand people who spam their terrible youtube channels
Ya! Nintendo is for kids! Now join me on my expensive PC and let's play stardew valley like MEN!!
I really hope [NAME] gets a great helm. A crown would be cool but I want a properly armored sword and board knight.
Trust me, if its a person you have feelings for and she/ he just wants your body, thats really painful.
I've seen a number of them on there. I regret seeing most of them but some are legit movies.
You said an untrue thing. Own up to it, asshole.
I’m convinced WB is more of a pain than it’s worth. Good luck making adjustments during the semester. I feel your pain.
£20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can’t buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
I think it it would have been even worse if that was the case
You're right :) It's not all about aim though Anyways, [NAME] hard to hit lol D:
Low effort bait, not even creative or funny.
How aren’t you in fucking school
The world needs a lil crazy
Here’s hoping!
because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
oh no, I didn’t mean one of my boyfriends haha, I meant one of his things. we’re not in an open relationship
Hopefully [NAME] has a chance to get some decent Exotics as a free agent
Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
I've had 1, 2, and 4 said to me. I'm completely done at this point.
“I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.”
I like how she dabs on the way down.
Thanks friend lol
Oof, that's rough. :( Sorry that happened to you, mate. 
lmao she WHAT
Weird, no formatting was applied. I changed to text
Thank you I hate it
Artificial bacon is always so bad. I think its just smoke flavor.
I'm literally in tears right now. Everything you said is true oh my godddddddddddddd.
Makes me sad at how brain damage effects boxers so much
Thank you for ruining the [NAME] joke.
Honestly I wouldn’t mind. Glad he’s still in the NHL. Poor [NAME] was playing in the KHL last I heard.
With a lot of severe brain damage after being beat back to life with an ugly stick.
Freaking hate cats (that are like that)
Still a statistical minority by a great deal.
I really like Funhaus
I hate the marvel stuff. I do love stuff like murder mountain and you. So that’s a hit for me in the last month.
lol Holy shit.
/r/nbastreams is now posting home/away on their feeds, super easy to use.
Minor league team names are often embarrassing...Biscuits, Rumble Ponies, Sand Gnats. Baby Cakes is particularly awful though, I’ll grant you that.
It's disturbing that this tweet got so many likes. Like, this is why twitter has a cancerous reputation.
😡this was a scam
It's not a recessed center, there's an edge cut out around the outside. It's from the melting pot, best fondue restaurant! 
This picture really drives home that the CIS can be super terrifying when they want to.
Thank you for advice!!
Lmao this is excessive
I only meant it in kindness, I’ve loved this country so far. You’re all so damned friendly here
This gave me a bit of a wider perspective on playing my guitar, actually. So thank you.
It's all fun and games until your crush turns into a spaceship.
There is a huge hormone dump around 48-72 hours after birth. Totally normal. Take care of yourself, eat well, and get some rest.
The value of the knowledge from the books you could buy is priceless!
That's so awesome! (I am so jealous hahaha)
No, she's standing in the water after she pees.
I just don’t like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home.
Hopefully [NAME] is not included
Scripted but funny
I feel personally attacked.
I mean, it'd be nice to see some other teams in the championship anyways, it's been Bama vs. Clemson 3/4 past years
This might be the worst FO in Orlando magic history
I was thinking the same thing! Then I saw your flair.
I'm curious to see the difference, but sadly that's not really something you can just ask someone.
Once you love someone with a mental illness, you would do anything for that power to heal. 
natural selection will rape her anyway so...
What? No way do I want to see a Boston coach behind our bench!
"""I care about the nation and the world"" and ""I'd rather let trump win than vote democrat"" are opposites of eachother"
Great news. Hopefully we can get a PLP that is more representative of the membership.
Hardly surprising. Now they also lost their coach... rip
That was a great interview
This is not good.
What's good kid? Sorry for the racism.
As far as I know you can only get one RI in a day.
So sorry about your loss. It's so heart wrenching xoxox
My grandparents were holocaust survivors. Seeing things like this and trying to comprehend the horrors that they had to endure really helps put my problems into perspective.
That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.
I mean, I’m an occasional monarchist myself. That doesn’t mean I’m under some delusion that it’s a fix all.
This is awesome!
I don't.
What a cataclysm
So cute!!!!!!!!!!
I had a total of 5 pet chickens. No way I could've ever eaten any of them. Glad that gfather confirmed that Banana Chip was buried.
No I don’t, why can’t you bring your hand to do it?
Not sure I understand, the legion is in a pretty good place right now in terms of their power
Great report! They are correct, it was never a hack.
That's crazy I just watched two of his movies last night. Unbreakable and split. Very interesting movies.
Yah, totally. It's just kind of scary when all you hear are loud extremes on both sides. 
"I hate it when the suits call our oncology program a ""service line"""
Mate, just stop. You’re being an embarrassment.
Burn it! er uh give it to your priest to burn it!
delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/
For as long as she’s been gone, I’m terrified to think why she was kept alive that long.
These are good ideas, thank you so much.
5 days?!? But I'm mad now!
Unfortunately half the country are not being reasonable.
I hear lobsters are great
Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator. 
You crush them up
So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That’s a nasty bruise under his fingernail.
W crazy game
Ew, this comment needs to die. Adultery is the most cowardly option you could ever pick.
What the fuck is wrong with this?!?!?!??? FUCKKKKKKKK!!!!!
FUCKING READ IDIOT
I love [NAME], he’s literally the craziest couch in the nba lol! He could win couch of the year or be fired next week! 
I've wanted this for so long.
May your recovery be swift and your memory of her abuse soon be distant. Safe and happy travels.
Just a pretty parrot. He pops over to say g'day to a mate of mine most sunny arvo's.
ahhh sorry its late and bourbon fuzz has set in. thanks for the fast reply !!!!
Hey now, don’t try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub. 
I’m glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red.
I would like a link as well, please. :)
Such a nice photo of city hall.
Or, orrrrr. All Girls Poop Mindset Only video you need to naturally have confidence when you socialize All Girls 
On my way! Thanks!
They’re honestly a cult at this point. It’s not just sad, but incredibly scary.
>It's not that I care Every reply now is you crying about being downvoted lol
Bingo! “I tried but those dirty libtards wouldn’t fund it. Sad.” Will be involved somewhere
Millennial here. Have a few motorcycles, none of them Harleys. I do not like overpriced, unreliable and bad performing vehicles. 
As an Aaron Jones owner, I did hate [NAME]. Lol but I’d still like the hire and just pray he becomes more innovative.
Lol ok. So saying a garbage clip doesn't belong at the top of a gaming subreddit makes me a [NAME].
Holy shit.
Tyl has got to be the most cringey, condescending thing I've seen on Reddit in a while.
Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
And sing the beat !
One of those is not like the others.
Holy shit this golden comment flew under the radar. I laughed so hard
[NAME] bless [NAME]
This is peak level of marketing inception. When people promote your movie by admiring your promotion of the movie.
Sad thing is, I wanted to, but I’m stupidly awkward...
As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me.
so cute. your art style is adorable. imagine if you made a mini-comic drawing!
almost [NAME] can do it !!
Imagine the jockey explaining that to his boss and then cranking the legs to raise it while everyone looks on :)
Lol it was a joke. Meta from r/askreddit
Don't think we should be stomping all over people's bodily autonomy just so public health authorities can declare victory.
This joke hasn't really worked since the 11th Century. Even then it wasn't that funny.
I cannot be more clear myself: If you do not have a comparable situation, you do not have a valid point to be making
Too bad =(
Never underestimate the stupidity of people
The snapchat news feed on the stories page is horrendous, its entirely just celebs, porn and hookup culture shit. 
No need to bully me.
[NAME] still the best dev tho. Nice nonsense comparison btw.
Yeah transgenders are stupid.
Anyone remember mean [NAME] burger and fries? That place was the jam!
Thanks! I didn't understand til now
Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
I would love to accidentally get muscular... Instead of working my arse off to lose fat at the moment.
We didn't win in Alvalade even when they got 7th place. We just have some sort of block there
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
awesome!!!! I believe in you!!!!!
Think you mean this Labour MP
No one in particular....i mean to people who believe that [NAME] and [NAME] are actually in love.
"What I'm suggesting is that since companies are ""people"" in the terms of citizens united, something like this could have some interesting unintended consequences."
Hopefully that's patched soon.
Yep, hell of a listener
Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. 
Ha, nope! Trying to distract myself on mobile in a really boring meeting. r/whoosh
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
Don't know why anyone would need more explanation than this video
Cider, its an acceptable drink to get drunk when you don't like the taste of beer and too much of a man to drink moscato
I‘m sorry this guy is harassing you, check his history, he‘s trolling.
Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
Someone who evidently doesn’t really know much about football or doesn’t do a simple google search before posting.
I see, thanks for the clarification.
Omg stop spamming.
I love this passive aggressiveness!!
Luckily, everyone regrets MySpace. 
I can't do it anymore today, I'm out. 
It seems like good advice.
I were wondering what's the deal with the second pic .Nice find .
Ha interesting. Grew up in MN and never thought about this.
Ugh obviously that's not what I meant, what I meant is that *socially* if they have a sibling that they do not need humans *socially*. 
"My dad makes that joke ""I have to fight anorexia"", his BMI is 31..."
I love making peoples’ names verbs related to things they do!
My fav character
Tell her to stop eating shit and start using mouthwash.
Yeah, that's what we call it too. Have you been to Madina Masjid in Toronto? 
Thanks again.
Baby cake!
That pole and cheap plastic fence surely would offer excellent protection from a car. Walk it off brah.
It's vodka/tonic time for me buddy! I'm off work!!!! Hope all yaw be safe and have a great night!
How many times has this ‘football fan’ committed these crimes now. Someone should lock him up.
[NAME] steals the game! (and the puck for bouncing off of Detroit players)
Like I said, I’m glad that’s working out for him but for most of the world being gainfully employed societal norms absolutely matter.
Except for that ridiculous tongue action, she has quite a pretty face.
You have clear issues, get help.
As someone who has been in a similar relationship, it is indeed emotional abuse.
Sorry man, losing the championship after picking him up this year is a tough break
Happy cake day bot!!
Yeah level 3 armor was so overwhelming and felt like you had no chance against it unless the player was really bad or you had more concussion grenades
Yeah. I killed them both.
There's so much missing information that is hard to dissect. Did you initiate the divorce? What was the reason for the divorce?
Wish they would’ve cancelled work when it was -40 last week but I guess that’s somewhat expected in Canada.
Hopefully never, both the result of truly dreadful storylines.
the NT-242 is my favorite battlefront weapon, by far.
"""And then I apologized and expressed remorse over the situation"" "
I hate waking up. Being asleep doesn’t last long enough. Being asleep is so peaceful.
Don’t take this seriously man, I was joking.
So. Much. Reality.Can’t. Take. Anymore. Reality. Not. Scripted.One.Bit. 🙃
You shifty leafs were too nice. Something had to be up.
I did it. Lol.
Happy Cake day!
That's fine I'll still be here calling out your ridiculousness regardless.
To be fair, it is worse than staying in the EU, but good grief it's better than a no deal.
The problem with crypto is typically when people have a bad feeling about something it rarely turns out well
Friend of the younger sister of girl who was killed. She told me it was a bad acid trip. Very sad, family is holding a vigil tomorrow night. 
Best of luck
I'm not to proud of them right now. I'm mad at them ☹☹ But big ups!!
What is this fucking r/niceguys bullshit?
That seems like an issue with you not him
For me it's how much I love canned black beans that take a minute and forty five seconds in the microwave lol.
This too shall pass In 10 years this could turn out to be the best thing that has ever happened to you.
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
I’m offended that your offended
Childhood is happiness. After that the rest of your life is spent chasing that feeling, a feeling that you’ll never experience again 
Thanks. Sounds like a bummer about 3, but maybe I should go back to 1 and check that out again.
A buddy of mine took his exes ring and taped it to the top of a firework mortar then set it off. It was glorious
almost every single time i have a friend from out of state visit, they make a comment about how bumpy our roads are
Oh goody, another idiot trying to tell other people what we believe. You are trolling, end of fact.
Youre fantastic. Thanks! How cute
I mourn for you anti-intellectuals
All good man haha
which is the very issue because he banned me
Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly. 
"""You people""? I think [NAME] is a moron but I think the [NAME] hysteria is equally if not more so moronic."
Sounds like you two have something in common.
So pretty! Great piping!
Oh shit lol I forgot to put “ashamed.”
it's a good thing they had a screen protector on it
I agree with this coked-up fiend.
Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies.
When I am outside for daily errands, then it sometimes is inevitable, unfortunately 
I understand. Thank you for the suggestion.
I might not agree with the maduro regime, but t how can BoE justify what amounts to stealing $1.2 billion in gold from Venuzuela? 
Congratulations on your shiny spine! I really hope your boyfriend backs you up but even if not, we all do! 
OK, I think I can binge and rebinge the entire run 20 or 30 more times before then, PHEW!
It would be pretty epic if [NAME], the artist that did the San Bernadino '17 poster, did the cover art for the new album... 
This communities inability to understand sarcasm is absolutely awe inspiring.
Yes I prefer smaller boobs
Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!
I'm also enjoying it I like mixing the colors the most.
Thanks for your words. I appreciate hearing from you. You bring up some very disturbing points.
I don’t think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
I like it A LOT.
Awe! That sucks!
I hate that this is true. Some of these offices are such a pain to find and cash tips are never part of the equation
I did not know that. Thanks!
I enjoy vintage cooking porn. A young [NAME] trussing a round roast, for example. 
You're not a good person if you make the person that just let you inside their body feel bad and disrespected.
Exactly, last year was frustrating with our [NAME] awful home record. 
Is a really worrying bench
Yeah, there are trees that are far older than 521 years.
>I have, on multiple occasions, enjoyed sipping on my flask of scotch at Bowness 
Nope. I don't think so either. Same thing I noticed with a couple of accounts that posted here at ESS recently.
Thanks - Glad I did not waste the money / gold
Oh, no wonder I like her so much!
[NAME] fuck my brain hurts, way to early for this shit. Sorry in advance if English is a 2nd language 
I never believe draft rumors of who teams are looking at or wanting, especially if its fan rumors. 
I'm so sorry. She's a very lucky cat to have people who love her so much.
Excellent work thank you for this. This is why I love Reddit.
I totally believe it, it's crazy how many drivers are so unaware of their lights
I’m sorry to inform you that this man is an imposter. I’m actually undercover atm.
They're upset because, if the slime that makes 4chan stink were to congeal into a person, it would be [NAME].
Wow. I dig that.
I was AF enlisted too hahaha
I think it was just a poorly worded title, what it meant to me was that there was a reason other than teaching kids to count. 
Where I live this standard, however they would of only been together just three weeks. Great news for you guys thou.
I really hate ginger ale. With a passion. The scenario in that scene makes me sick to my stomach.
"It's more like ""Get tinder or any of the apps and get rejected hundreds of times a day"""
Thank you. Give her and your other doggie extra kisses for me. ❤️
Maybe slw the fuck down eh
Obviously. Just like men are not raping or beating their wives. Rapists and wife beaters are. Thanks for playing.
I love how the dog is just happy the cat is giving him attention.
I’m really high and laughed too hard at this video, normally I would feel really bad for the old fella.
I'll give you that. Society is generally in a decline. I don't date men so I can't speak to that.
Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna 
I don't particularly want an Eagles repeat either. Chargers, Colts or Chiefs would make me feel best. Then Rams and Saints.
See as sad as I am I can’t hate anyone here.
It's so beautiful out. If only the sun wasn't so consistently low.
Also the least satisfying answer but probably true haha
Thank you kindly.... I appreciate the support. Could you elaborate on the tip please? Thank you
Hahah you right. Please don't tell any birds!
yes the one place i can reinvent myself over and over without killing the bank account. i think the things there carry a certain personality with them too
Happened this afternoon, January 21, 2019 in the Central South-East area. So frustrating! 
Oh no he didn't!
Wow you just disregarded his entire comment.
Umm how about “Sorry I tried to kidnap our son.” He could start there.
rich people usually tip the worst lol
You’re good, no worries
Humans are complex beings that we don't as people still don't understand completely. That is why.
B, I dont frink coffee anyways 
Yeah, I am! I'll private message you a link to my profile. Thank you.
Wooow! Thank you! Amazing
Can someone tell me the difference? Sorry, please don't get mad at me...
Stop it. You're giving me that warm fuzzies now.
Okay thanks. I'll see if I can find out how to do that.
There’s a lot of us ladies here, unfortunately 😔
Unpopular opinion: I'd rather the team signed 26-year-old [NAME] over 30-year-old [NAME] coming off another leg injury.
[NAME] I hate plant thieves. They’re almost certainly ppl who should know better.
Same, actually. Funny, just saw him in a local video doing the same bit.
Cool so you saw something already posted, didn't want to believe and did it yourself to post it all again?
Most important win of the season. Awesome
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
We just got paper straws and we have to ask everyone if they want one first. it's anoying.
I think he's probably (hopefully) more interested in the URL of the page... :D
i dunno, you commit one little genocide and you never hear the fucking end of it
[NAME] loves it
When there is 1 in 20 posts that is remotely serious and it gets 20 upvotes Vs 1200 of those that memes get...
This is worse, Balo looks like a horse
But he seemed really enthusiastic! And he was wearing really expensive boots!
or a horrible night of 15/4/4
I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!
Just a quick correction: if the next tax bracket is 10% than $10001 would be taxed $500.10
I love you tooooo!!
It was always kind of a consideration when I did have opening and closing blinds. None of them problems anymore.
Never will happen because of abortion legality. Party/religion over country
I really want pizza right now
Why in the world did you marry her? She's ragging on your own sister???
omg that's gonna be a hell of a reunion as well
What dose are you taking and how long did it take to help? I've been trying the Lazarus 50mg/ml. Not seeing any obvious improvement so far.
But balance does not include the dark side
Yep. They'll declare a national emergency and use army troops to seize all the plastic straws from chick fil a restuarants in the country
Afro samurai lol, that's pretty interesting never new they actually existed. I'm woman though so that wouldn't work for me 
Well no dur
Can’t be worse than last week
It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
Everyday for the last year and a half has been very hard and I should be glad she's gone. I'm almost there.
Thank you I love you
Sad but true
PLACE THE DEVICE ON HER HEAD HA HA HA TIME TO DIE
Wrong. You tried to use a WW2 example and it backfired on you.
Yes, this! You are too young to wasting your time with this. 
I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. 
I also relate (and regret)
I'm missing something
As long as I have my plasma rifle and some combat armour, I think I can traverse the wastes without a ride just fine. 
They’re proud about having liberals make themselves look stupid with covfefe memes.
Because they don't realize that the Act of Union occurred. Either that or people don't like that this guy is being pedantic.
I personally like [NAME] and think he could be on the team right now, but the Org doesn't agree.
Ex-Marines are the best.
It's not his job to train you.
Haha, that’s meeee! 
Don’t laugh the way this game went I actually expected he will lay it in... then reality and [NAME] hit... thanks goodness
The [NAME] of horror!
Last time i knew stealing posts from other people wasnt a rule
Thanks a lot, [NAME]. Now I've lost my train of thought!
damn it I was holding out for [NAME] to carry the game
Thanks for your recommendation! My guy loves board games and those sound like they'd scratch our itches.
There's literally nothing wrong with it except you being worried about the purity of your partner like c'mon.
My boyfriend is transitioning and I hope he turns out as handsome as you!
But tbh, i dont think i am disgusting, but my feet still get smelly after a while 
Thanks for recognizing me bud. And yes I will take some crap to go please
I’ll check out and see if is!! Thank you ☺️
I fucking love this GIF so much.
You admit to discrimination based on your personal criteria. Say no more.
Well, its been hours and I was correct. The OPs comment was totally 100% incorrect. Have a great day, thanks for playing. LMAO!
Yes.
Hmm... I don't think EPCOR is the reason the oilers suck
ah good find. I guess I saw some sort of grade 9 class photo then. Cheers.
Yes it would be a poorly thought out plan... involving alcohol... never heard of one of those.
It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
Get him boys!
Your artwork is amazing.
What's up, man? I'm new to this but I will try my best 
Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation.
Search results are indeed based on personal search history. The first result I get searching Canadian Soldiers is [NAME], haha
I don’t watch the Colts, but out of interest do they insist on making [NAME] block consistently like we did.
Yeah. You obviously can read the mind of all the voters.
Stop spraying chemicals daily in the sky.
Ain't that the truth, lol
I tried Skelth, it's pretty old and feels like not too active anymore.
Wow OP sounds like you're really skilled at opening your legs, you're parents should be proud of you, STI and all.
Twas a joke ❤️
Omg the etsy side hustle. I have time to do that, and it fulfills me so much
"I mean they're just kids at the end of the day, the people yelling racist things are the ""adults"""
Aw here goes!
The Guardian are covering it. Naturally they think we're far-right activists and misogynists whose displeasure proves the necessity of the [NAME] campaign...
Yea true , it sucks that theater mode doesn’t work its broken as hell in this game 
Great news. Maybe they will be shut down.
Still annoying.
Who the hell has reddit in anything other than dark mode ??
This is alternative facts level populism. The man is a liar.
It's not exactly hard to keep track.
That's my wife ❤
Ah, I see. Thanks for the clarification.
Too bad [NAME] is a bad person if abandoned and tries to kill you as well. Her singing was really nice..
> While less than 1% of DV accusations end up being unsubstantiated I find that incredible.
I'm so glad you got your angel back. Also she is trying to monopolize DHs free time.
Recent Russian behavior is unacceptable...no doubt about it.
Make this a weekly PSA, please!! Lmao 
That convention center sized groan right after the reveal.... No one wanted this. I have no idea what they were thinking.
My mistake. I just glanced over your last post.
So what's so funny about what you just said?
Nah, my comment stands. Poor effort. 
bet he loves to slow dance
Benzos do not help anxiety long term. they make it worse
Agghh this is amazing! Wish I had thought of something like this when I was leaving retail!
This definitely sounds like bipolar mania or a schizophrenic episode. I hope he gets some help.
What you are describing is what I am feeling right now aswell. It's hard to handle the fact but atleast you aren't alone.
Until he goes back to school on Tuesday and all his friends are SO RELIEVED that he’s back safely.
Many great years in these jerseys, would love to see them come back as our 3rds with the 1970s originals for the 50th Anniversary season
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
PD would probably get us [NAME] so we would all get pump faked until you realize he got the wrong one. Exhibit A [NAME] -_-
Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations
Yo u r awesome op. Gold me :D
If you are as ugly as you say you are, you're already a statistical outlier.
This guy doesn’t like fox hunting because “toffs” do it. As with all policies of the left, it’s grounded in jealousy. 
[NAME]* that would have been sliiiiick
I almost felt sorry for him. Almost.
She accidentally tagged someone with the last name Bells
Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/
She probably just said it because it rhymes, sorry Op
Yeah that is a pretty crap and unhelpful thing to say, especially coming from someone who works in that job. 
You are a treasure. Please know how wonderful you are. Big hugs to you.
Yes!!!! Great weekend. As others have said, I can now enjoy the rest of the playoffs
voted! threw a couple of my other favorites in there too. thanks for the heads up!
Safe rooms and hidden passages, I hope.
heyyy that’s my birthday as well!
Ah what a bummer! Better kill them herons & spoonbills!
Oh man this gave me some flashbacks to awesome times playing with my dad
There are no male versions of feminists. Men live in a different social reality than women.
Grey socks and leather sandals, that hurts me through the screen.
No, stop! He'll stop cranking the job machine if you insult him again!
Oh poor guy. That’s so sad. I can see why she is an ex friend.
"Look, [NAME]! I'm a cat. ""Ffs, [NAME]. Get off the ground. You're embarrassing me."""
that made me feel bad for nw
How dare you make an attempt to be kind!
Calling Hollywood...would make a great movie.☺
I'd be fine on the highway, really only stop and go and hill starts, and reversing that I have problems with. 
All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man 
I was worried about that too honestly
Cheers brother. That’s very interesting. First time I’ve seen that article.
I mean it sucks but that man looks deaded
Just gonna be mean here, those are all hideous :(
Nope, midwest. I'd bet there are a bunch of shops with the same stuff though. P.S. I love your name!
[NAME] making moves, as much as I still miss [NAME] I'm excited to see our teams future.
That's not fickle. That's insane and delusional. It's not some cute little quirk. It's a disconnect with reality.
That’s exactly what I was thinking but doesn’t it sound super cool?!?
Yes, protecting women from sexual assault is offensive.
I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile.
I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
Weird, Tuxedo Mask looks shorter and pudgier than I pictured him to be
I got the 4K Blu-Ray and the Mrs and I are convinced you see more than butt in that scene.
Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!
It is so refreshing to have [NAME] gone.
Horribly fake. People on that thread are stupid and gullible.
I feel like someone smart will go pound bama on the ML right now. But that person won’t be me lol.
I love to watch [NAME] play tbh
I loved [NAME]. He didn't seem evil at all!
I think it's weird that he didn't just wake you up and weirder that he didn't tell you until you noticed it was missing.
Actually pretty :(( as [NAME] since the Hair is one big abomination and it could have been sooooo cool.
I love it. Probably my favorite game mode right now. Especially when playing with a buddy.
Lol, nah, that team was nothing more than nyxl and friends. Nyxl coach, and mostly nyxl players.
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!
Better slap that car roof.
Blizzard was working with Activision long before Hots. I'm afraid its too late now, to divorce.
Don't judge our love
I hope marvel brings [NAME] on for star lords new love interest
the tears of unfathomable sadness ... mmm yummy!
I think that's a reference to how fucking mad watching [NAME] makes people feel. ie shit [NAME] is playing and now I have the furies!
[NAME] looks miserable in those photos.
Woah, how manly.
What a nice moment. Being in nature is super helpful to me for these moments :)
Holy [NAME], our hope and handmaid of the [NAME], pray for us!
I didn't realize CPO was an add-on available, I just saw their advertising. Thanks!
This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
Awesome! Thanks! I'll start the process tomorrow!
I LOVE THE HIGHS TOO. At least I know tomorrow I will hate them. Is the good worth the bad? Sometimes...
The Donald raiders are the most savage of the bunch, they not only downvote brigade but also annihilate civil debates 
As a student in DC Universities I hope to fucking god they get rid of blackboard and replace it with canvas.
Honestly if I didn't have this many favorite characters not yet in the game, I would probably waste my 7 votes on Merlinus.
Is your job my job? Because I don't know what it is about hardware stores that make Ppl stupid but hell are they stupid...
CBD dog treats. They’ve worked wonders for my dog when it comes to fireworks.
Sadly I see it being a call to party like there is no tomorrow for the vast majority.
“[NAME] = [NAME] = [NAME]” 🤣😂 It truly takes a DEVOTED moron to embrace that nonsense.
I hate poetry
Won't continue. But the positive thing is it's not on fire shooting. It's great ball movement.
You can't talk morality to psychopaths.
Because it would look worse than 2D art.
It makes me super fucking nervous edit: was able to buy temple at +1 fuck it lets ride
What the hell are you talking about?
"It's gonna be the next ""live, laugh, love"" with everyone running around talking about if things ""spark joy"""
[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
They didn’t you lying sack of shit. This sub has no moderators.
My hair never scrunched and I was so jealous
Omg that’s a perfect idea! I obviously want to avoid the stalker thing but I do love basketball and understand it so this seems possible
Ahhh okay my bad I misread your comment, I thought you meant we’d be trading him if he plays poorly 
Reminds me of that chick and the lizard, [NAME], and 7-11 tried to get the store number lol
Thanks for your input, I should have clarified the pop part of pop psych.
This made me smile. I watched it on YouTube.
i guess you must eat filets and lobster at all your parties haha
Peaky Blinders is the shit. I don't understand how there isn't more hype around this show.
I really want a WW1 [NAME]. It would be amazing.
As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot
I always love her reaction. She acts like life is over.
Cute pupper 😍😍😍
Nice try, bot!
I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
Nah, just gotta aim better.
Jazz fan here. I completely feel. [NAME] cousins has more votes than [NAME], and [NAME] hasn't even stepped on the court this year
Woof thank goddddd I changed my flair
Was impressed til I saw you main [NAME]
Let’s go [NAME], prove everyone wrong.
Thanks. We'll do our best :)
Sorry, but [NAME] doesn’t even compare to [NAME].
[NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
Cuddling. God damn is it comforting to just snuggle up in my girlfriend's arms and sit there for a while
That shit really just made my night. Haha
ITS TO THE POINT WHERE I LOVE AND I HATE YOU
The characters and story are really enjoyable. The dungeons are awesome. Generally decent sidequests. Fun items. Cool art style and character designs
I changed from [NAME] to [NAME] last night because I panicked. I am very pleased with my decision.
